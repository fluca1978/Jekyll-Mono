Me, Myself and My Dogs
---

So far, I've had three dogs, all small in size. While I have to admit that dogs are much more interactive and friendly than cats, [*I do like cats the most*](/cats)*.

# Jack

The first dog has been **Jack**, a black and white basset-like dog. It was a really nice dog, very calm and friendly. I remember, back in those days, he was walking around the neighbour to the local butcher, and then coming back with a bone in his mouth.
My father gave special credits to Jack using his picture as his own avatar over the network.

# Flipper

A lot of years later, **Flipper** gain access to home. He was a really beautiful *hard-fur basset*, son of the running world champion. He was my father's dog, even if he was tied to my mother for the most of the time.
My mother gave special credits to Flipper keeping a giant photo of him in her photo shop.

# Franzina

The last arrived, mostly due to the will of my wife and son, has been **Franzina** (*fringy*).
I really don't like the name, but since she is used to it we decided to keep it.

We saved her out of the kennel, and she is in love with my wife and my son. 
Damn, I guess myself has been demoted to *"the one who buys food"* and my son and wife are the "nice members" of the family. At least, this is the perception that I have about our animals!

Franzina is, of course, my son's first dog.
