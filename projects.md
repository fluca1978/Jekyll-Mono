Nothing really interesting here.
Today I have very little time to start-up a project from scratch, and so I try to help (a little) existings ones.
In the past I did mess with:

* [`Aglets`](http://aglets.sourceforge.net/) a Java based mobile agent platform.

* `Blackcat` it was my master degree thesis, renamed `RoleX` because university did not feel comfortable with animal names! There is no
repository or source code available (because I'm too lazy to pick it back from a backup). The idea was that of doing Java class runtime
manipulation on the fly as performed by other more useful tools (like persistence frameworks). Several research publications exist on the subject.

* [`WhiteCat`](https://github.com/fluca1978/WhiteCat) the evolution of `BlackCat`, again Java bytecode manipulation on the fly. Several research publications exist on the subject.

* [`flap`](https://github.com/fluca1978/flap) a didactical mobile agent platform written in Java used to teach mobility do students.

* [`JFK`](https://github.com/fluca1978/JFK) trying to port *signals and slots* the Qt way to Java, or better a rudimental way to implement function pointers (because they don't scare you, right?).

More in general I tend to keep all my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/fluca1978), so go [check there!](https://github.com/fluca1978).


I did participate in the **CPAN Pull Request Challenge** 2015 and **Hacktoberfest 2016**. I really encourage anyone else in participating in projects like those because they can teach you a lot and your time will not be wasted onto a not-so-used piece of code.

I co-founded and directed the **[Italian PostgreSQL Users' Group (ITPUG)](http://www.itpug.org)** and have actively organized almost all [PGDay.IT](http://www.pgday.it) events, introducing (not by myself) also the concept of *ITPUG Lab*.
