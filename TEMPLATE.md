Why did Perl 6 took so many years to be released?

## A point of view about Perl 6 timeline
-----

It was July the 19 2000 (my birthday!) when the Perl 6 development was announced to the world, and it took until the Christmas eve in 2015
to produce the first official stable release. It rouglhy means 15 years of development.

It is a huge amount of time for a language version bump, except *this has not been a "simple" version number bump!*.
Yes, it is well known now that Perl 6 is not a new version of the Perl 5 language, but it is a new language itself.
