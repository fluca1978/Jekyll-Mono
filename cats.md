**Am I a cat trapped into an human body?**

# Me, Myself and my Cats

Nothing special here: I grew up with always at least a cat on my side.
But the intimate approach with such feline strongly influenced my mindset at the point I sometime believe I'm myself a cat.
**It is not just an intimate feeling with cats, it is that I recognize myself in their behavior.**

During my life several cats lived with me and my family, but only a few of them did get a special place into my life. Therfore, I tried to recognize the great value they added, as well as the influence, on my life.



For the records, here is a chronological list of my personal *starred cats*, so far. This does not mean that all the other cats do mean less to me, it is just the cats listed here are those I recognize myself the most with.



## Duchessa

Duchessa was **my very first cat**, the one that grown up with me since I was a little two-years old human being.

I clearly remember her appearing each time I was crying, gently pulling my hair with her claws to make me stop and laugh.
Duchessa was a real predator, eating any sort of tasty animal she was able to catch (especially rats and birds).

Credits for the above photo are to the **best photographer I ever met**, formerly known as **my father**, and has won several competitions. You have to understand it back when the digital photography was just a dream, and being able to shoot at great distance a moving animal was a real challenge.

Duchessa died due to an accident when I was a middle-school student.

**When I went public on the net with my first blog, I placed such photo on the top of the site to emphasize my feelings for Duchessa*.


## Miguel (aka *Puccio*)

Miguel, also known as *Puccio*, was a male black and white cat that lived with us along with his sister.
I don't know exactly why, but Puccio trusted myself the most, and I clearly remember he miewling each time he saw me.

Unluckily, Puccio disappear in the spring of the 2002, when I was approaching my master degree thesis.
Threfore, **I decided to name my source code tree as `BlackCat` in his honor (even if was not fully black!)**, university forced me to namely switch to *RoleX* because my tutors did not like the idea of having an animal as project name (no matter they were stoling a famous clock brand name).
Anyway, the source tree and build system kept the original `BlackCat` name and I also elaborate a web site image as main logo of the documentation and, of course, of the GUI.

## Carmensita (aka *Puccia*)

Carmensita, also known as *Puccia*, was the sister of Puccio, a long fur black and white cat.

She totally replaced Puccio after he disappear, becoming my mate during the cold afternoons I spent studying and working for my PhD. I remember she coming to me from wherever she was just because I called her name, most likely an obedient and devote dog, than a cat.

I often refer to Puccia as a **generational cat** since she entered my family when I was finishing the high school and died after my marriage, covering therefore a long period over which my life changed (I got the driving licence, I graduated, got a PhD, a job, and a wife).

My tribute to her was similar to the one I did for Puccio: when I left university and worked on my own for another research project, **I named the whole project (and not just the source tree) WhiteCat**, producing also a logo of her sleeping on our terrace edge.

So far, I can state that **BlackCat was a tribute to Puccio, being him black for the most**, while **Whitecat was a tribute for Puccia being her white for the most**.


## Sofia

It takes more than five years to make my brain accept the idea of interacting with other cats. I suspect that after a *generational cat* you commited almost for life, there was a kind of natural resistance.

Anyway, with the great experience with Duchessa, I decided (according to my great wife) that even our son needed a cat.

Entering Sofia.
Sofia is the first **fully black** cat that ever lived with me.
Sofia is also the very first cat of my son.

Maybe because this situation reminds me myself and Duchessa, maybe because Sofia appears to me as very elegant with her velvet black fur, or maybe because there's just a strong tie between us, she is a very important cat in my life.

And the positive credits for the above are that I started using **Sofia as my profile image for both my web site and account (mail, GitHub, and so on)**.
