**Am I a cat trapped into an human body?**

## Me, Myself and my cats
I did and still have *cats*.

Often I believe I'm myself a cat, since I liked observing what is happening around me without taking care of, as well as sleeping in front of the fire place and walk alone in the nature.

So I'm a cat passionate, and no surprise, I'm not the only one on earth!
But among all the cats I've had in the past, there were (and still are) some that really changed my mind and my life, and I used as inspiration while doing my computer science activity.
