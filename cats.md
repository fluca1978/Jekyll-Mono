**Am I a cat trapped into an human body?**

# Me, Myself and my Cats

Nothing special here: I grew up with always at least a cat on my side.
But the intimate approach with such feline strongly influenced my mindset at the point I sometime believe I'm myself a cat.
**It is not just an intimate feeling with cats, it is that I recognize myself in their behavior.**

During my life several cats lived with me and my family, but only a few of them did get a special place into my life.
That's why I want to publicly state about their role and importance for me.


As a computer geek, back in the time when I was using an email client to manage all my incoming emails (and it was **KMail**, for the record), I changed the reply and forward quotes to appear like the following:

*reply quote*

    On 4 July 2009 your cat, walking on the keyboard, wrote:

and *forward quote*

    On 6 September 2010 Luca's cat found this was interering:

just to emphasize how I was committed to *cats*! Today I read pretty much all my email via the web, and I never find out another client to allow me to customize the reply and forward quotes so far, so my email replies are more boring.

For the records, here is a chronological list of my personal *starred cats*, so far. This does not mean that all the other cats do mean less to me, it is just the cats listed here are those I recognize myself the most with.



## Duchessa

Duchessa was **my very first cat**, the one that grown up with me since I was a little two-years old human being.

I clearly remember her appearing each time I was crying, gently pulling my hair with her claws to make me stop and laugh.
Duchessa was a real predator, eating any sort of tasty animal she was able to catch (especially rats and birds).

Credits for the above photo are to the **best photographer I ever met**, publicly known as **my father**, who  has won several competitions with such photo. You have to understand it was back when the digital photography was just a dream, and being able to shoot at great distance a moving animal was a real challenge.

Duchessa died due to an accident when I was a middle-school student.

*When I went public on the net with my first blog, I placed her photo on the top of the site to emphasize my feelings for Duchessa*.


## Miguel (aka *Puccio*)

Miguel, also known as *Puccio*, was a male black and white cat that lived with us along with his sister.
I don't know exactly why, but Puccio trusted myself the most, and I clearly remember he miewling each time he saw me.

Unluckily, Puccio disappear in the spring of the 2002, when I was approaching my master degree thesis.
Threfore, **I decided to name my source code tree as `BlackCat` in his honor (even if was not fully black!)**, university forced me to namely switch to *RoleX* because my tutors did not like the idea of having an animal as project name (no matter they were stoling a famous clock brand name).
Anyway, the source tree and build system kept the original `BlackCat` name and I also elaborate a web site image as main logo of the documentation and, of course, of the GUI.

## Carmensita (aka *Puccia*)

Carmensita, also known as *Puccia*, was the sister of Puccio, a long-fur black-and-white cat.

She totally replaced Puccio after he disappear, becoming my mate during the cold afternoons I spent studying and working for my PhD. I remember she coming to me from wherever she was just because I called her name, most likely an obedient and devote dog, than a cat.

I often refer to Puccia as a **generational cat** since she entered my family when I was finishing the high school and died after my marriage, covering therefore a long period over which my life changed (I got the driving licence, I graduated, got a PhD, a job, and a wife).

My tribute to her was similar to the one I did for Puccio: when I left university and worked on my own for another research project, **I named the whole project (and not just the source tree) WhiteCat**, producing also a logo of her sleeping on our terrace edge.

So far, I can state that **BlackCat was a tribute to Puccio, being him black for the most**, while **Whitecat was a tribute to Puccia being her white for the most**.


## Sofia

It takes more than five years to make my brain accepting the idea of interacting with other cats.
I suspect it was due to my previous commitment to a *generational cat* (Puccia), and so  I had some subconcious resistance in accepting new cats.


Anyway, with the Duchessa experience in mind, me and my wife agreed in the need for our son to experience true contact with a cat.

Entering Sofia.

Sofia is the first **true black cat** in my life so far.
**Sofia is also my son  _very first cat_**.

Maybe because this situation reminds me Duchessa, maybe because Sofia appears to me as very elegant with her velvet black fur, or maybe because there's just a strong tie between us, she is a very important cat in my life.

And the positive credits for the above are that I began using **Sofia as my profile image for pretty much everything from my web site to my accounts (mail, phone, GitHub, etc.)**.

## Olivia

Olivia is not a *starred cat* of mine, rather I believe is the most important cat in my wife's life experience.

Olivia gained home access six months later than Sofia, and therefore it is the very second cat to my son. After an initial debate, Sofia and Olivia found an agreement on *house sharing* and today they appear much more as true sisters rather than roomates.

Olivia has some very interesting behavior, and threrefore I could not avoid taking her into account in my day-to-day activity. But even if really deserving photos, being a very beautiful cat, *my brain does have place for a-one cat at time*, therefore I gave credits to Olivia **naming my main computer system  after her**.
