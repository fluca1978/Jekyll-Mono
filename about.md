**I'm a software developer living in Italy with my beautiful wife, my great son, and my two (female) cats.**

I've always been fascinated by computers since the age of movies like *War Games*.
My very first computer was the very popular [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) that my father bought to me and placed
into a wardrobe with an old CRT television. I wrote a few programs using the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC) language, and did not found it very fun.

A few years later my grandpa gave me an [Intel 8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) based PC with a green monitor and, of course, a version of [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS). I remember doing a recursive `dir` on the 50MB disk running for a couple of seconds!

I grew up and got an [Intel 486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486) DX personal computer that I used to do some homework while attending school. After that a few [Intel Celeron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron) PCs took place on my desk, then it came a laptop, and a lot of other hardware I really don't remember.

I attended the *computer science* course at my local university, where I was (badly) introduce to `Unix`, or better to `Linux`. I felt in love with the philosophy of the system: you were not limited in any way, you could just type and do whatever you wanted piping a few commands.

My first Linux distro was a *Red Hat 5.2*, and since I was still not aware of the `root` concept (in the sense that Microsoft did not have to teach you such concept), I had to install it over and over again because I was jamming a few configuration files...
At my fourth year of university I did switch totally to `Linux`, keeping around a bootable [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) for those games and programs I was not aware to find a substitute.

My first job, luckily, allowed me to manage a few Linux servers, so I had the chance to improve my skills on such system.
After a few years I met [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) and [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) and I switched to the Unix culture.
Today I use both Linux and BSD as my own operating systems.

Being a Linux/BSD user meant to me I embraced the *Open Source* culture to the point I believe it is the **only sane way of producing software**.
Of course this does not mean I will do and accept only Open Source jobs and tasks, I can work comfortably even in environments where the code (and/or data) must be kept not-public.

So here's a brief description about *me*.

## Me by Achievements
<a name="achievements"></a>

There was a time when I thought achievements were really important.
Today I look back and truly believe
that is much more important to *demonstrate on the field my value, and not on a piece of paper*.
By the way, if you are interested, the following is an uncomplete list.

In the academic world:

* Master Degree in Computer Science, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, final vote `110/110 with honours`, year 2002
* PhD in Computer Science, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, year 2005
* Adjunct Professor, [Nipissing University](http://www.nipissingu.ca/), years 2011-2014
* lecturer at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia for several courses including `Java, OOP, operating systems`, years 2003-2006
* lecturer at local high schools for `HTML, Javascript, networking`, years 2009-2014`

In the computer science world:

* co-founder of the [Italian PostgreSQL Users Group](http://www.itpug.org), president between 2013-2015
* [BSD Magazine](https://bsdmag.org/) writer and reviewer
* lecturer at several PGDay.IT and LinuxDay events

In the archery world (when I was young):

* regional champion FITA, FIELD, INDOOR (several times)
* bronze medal at the individual national championships, twice: 1994, 1996

## Me by Skills
<a name="skills"></a>

Not a complete enumration, but this is what I use on an almost regular basis:

* **Java** - 15+ years;
* **Perl** - 15+ years;
* **PostgreSQL** - 10+ years;
* **Linux** - 18+ years
* **BSD** - 5+ years
* **Emacs** - 18+ years (it was my default editor since day one and yes, I don't know `vi`)
* **Git**, **Fossil** - 5+ years, and of course I know and I used older systems
* **C++** and **Qt** - no production experience, let's say I can manage them

Feel free to search for `fluca1978` on the forums, mailing list, IRC to validate the above.

## Me by Username
<a name="username"></a>

My public username is **`fluca1978`** and it has been since a lot, allowing for you to scout the net searching for my very first steps.
I strongly believe in keeping the username the same to let other people know my achievements and experience, as well as a way to prove
how long I was around on a particular subject.

The choice of the username has a particular meaning. When I was a child and was learning to write, I used to sign my homeworks with
`F.Luca`, where of course the capital `F` was for **F**errari. Having fun on me, my parents were used to read the whole string without themseparating dot, composing therefore `FLuca` and calling me with such nickname.
When it was time to set up my first internet account, as you can imagine, there was no combination of name and surname available for me, as well as there was no available `fluca`: in both cases I had to add a postfix number to say my account from another. Therefore I decided to place my year of birth, `1978`, which interestingly is the minimal and only set of numbers that I need to write my whole `d-m-y` birthday.

And that is how **`fluca1978`** took the field. Since then I changed a lot of account managers and service providers, so chances are you can find my username tied to different services, but you can be sure that account is mine.

Interestingly, I waited for my [archery career to stop before having a fully customized quiver](http://fluca1978.blogspot.it/2009/01/dragoon-took-field.html) with my nickname on it. Please consider this does not include the number because, well, in archery the nickname does not care.

## Me by Projects
<a name="projects"></a>


Today I have very little time to start-up a project from scratch, and so I try to help (a little) existings ones.
That is why I like to participat in *Hacktoberfest* or *CPAN PR*, that allow me to contribute and learn without having to waste time.
For a detailed view on what I can consider *projects* see the [projects page](/projects).


## Me by Blog
<a name="blog"></a>

In the blog you will find random thoughts pretty much on computer science related topics.
I do write sometime personal things, but tend not to do it very often.

## Me by Social Networks
<a name="social"></a>

No way!

I do not use social networks,
I don't like them, so if you need to get in touch with me *drop me an email or a phone call*.

## Me by Believings
<a name="believings"></a>

I do believe in *Open Source*.

I do believe in *automation*: why should I spend my time doing things the machine can do for me?

I do believe in *humanity*, *honesty* and *personal values*.

I do believe in *free culture*, in the sense that everyone should help each other to learn new things without secrets or speculation.

I'm catholic, but I'm working on this.
