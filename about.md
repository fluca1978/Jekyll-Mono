**I'm a software developer living in Italy with my beautiful wife, my great son, and my two (female) cats.**

I've always been fascinated by computers since the age of movies like *War Games*.
My very first computer was the very popular [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) that my father bought to me and placed
into a wardrobe with an old CRT television. I wrote a few programs using the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC) language, and did not found it very fun.

A few years later my grandpa gave me an [Intel 8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) based PC with a green monitor and, of course, a version of [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS). I remember doing a recursive `dir` on the 50MB disk running for a couple of seconds!

I grew up and got an [Intel 486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486) DX personal computer that I used to do some homework while attending school. After that a few [Intel Celeron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron) PCs took place on my desk, then it came a laptop, and a lot of other hardware I really don't remember.

I attended the *computer science* course at my local university, where I was (badly) introduce to `Unix`, or better to `Linux`. I felt in love with the philosophy of the system: you were not limited in any way, you could just type and do whatever you wanted piping a few commands.

My first Linux distro was a *Red Hat 5.2*, and since I was still not aware of the `root` concept (in the sense that Microsoft did not have to teach you such concept), I had to install it over and over again because I was jamming a few configuration files...
At my fourth year of university I did switch totally to `Linux`, keeping around a bootable [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) for those games and programs I was not aware to find a substitute.

My first job, luckily, allowed me to manage a few Linux servers, so I had the chance to improve my skills on such system.
After a few years I met [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) and [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) and I switched to the Unix culture.
Today I use both Linux and BSD as my own operating systems.

Being a Linux/BSD user meant to me I embraced the *Open Source* culture to the point I believe it is the **only sane way of producing software**.

## Me by Skills

Not a complete enumration, but this is what I use on a regular basis:

* **Java** - 15+ years;
* **Perl** - 15+ years;
* **PostgreSQL** - 10 years;
* **Linux** - 18 years
* **BSD** - 5 years
* **Emacs** - 18 years (it was my default editor since day one)
* **Git**, **Fossil** - 5+ years, and of course I know and I used older systems

But please, feel free to search for `fluca1978` on the forums, mailing list, IRC for an evaluation of the above.

## Me by Projects

Nothing really interesting here.
Today I have very little time to start-up a project from scratch, and so I try to help (a little) existings ones.
In the past I did mess with:

* [`Aglets`](http://aglets.sourceforge.net/) a Java based mobile agent platform.

* `Blackcat` it was my master degree thesis, renamed `RoleX` because university did not feel comfortable with animal names! There is no
repository or source code available (because I'm too lazy to pick it back from a backup). The idea was that of doing Java class runtime
manipulation on the fly as performed by other more useful tools (like persistence frameworks). Several research publications exist on the subject.

* [`WhiteCat`](https://github.com/fluca1978/WhiteCat) the evolution of `BlackCat`, again Java bytecode manipulation on the fly. Several research publications exist on the subject.

* [`flap`](https://github.com/fluca1978/flap) a didactical mobile agent platform written in Java used to teach mobility do students.

* [`JFK`](https://github.com/fluca1978/JFK) trying to port *signals and slots* the Qt way to Java, or better a rudimental way to implement function pointers (because they don't scare you, right?).

More in general I tend to keep all my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/fluca1978), so go [check there!](https://github.com/fluca1978).


## Me by Blog

In the blog you will find random thoughts pretty much on computer science related topics.
I do write sometime personal things, but tend not to do it very often.

## Me by Social

No way!
I do not use social networks, I don't like them, so if you need to get in touch with me drop me an email or a phone call.

## Me by Believings

I do believe in *Open Source*.

I do believe in *automation*: why should I spend my time doing things the machine can do for me?

I do believe in *humanity*, *honesty* and *personal values*.

I do believe in *free culture*, in the sense that everyone should help each other to learn new things without secrets or speculation.

I'm catholic, but I'm working on this.
