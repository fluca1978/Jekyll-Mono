Yesterday I got an email from an editor I write papers for (sometime), and it was a really sweet email to read.

# A positive email in my inbox

When I have time I try to write some short and technical articles. As already explained in this blog, I do that for sevveral reasons, mainly:
- spreading the Open Source word;
- let other people to know and get in touch with great projects I do use;
- learn something new and cool and transmit it to others.

So it happens I wrote a couple of articles again for **[BSD Magazine](http://www.bsdmag.org)**, and the subject was **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)**. As usual, papers undergo a review process to decide if they should be accepted, worked on, thrown away and so on.
The last review I got back included, among the others, the following statement:


    Luca's writing does in fact show his passion for FOSS.
    Tell him please, that he did a wonderful job on this [...]

That's really worth all the time spent in writing, testing, trying, experimenting and laying out a paper. And I'm really proud my passion for Open Source is perceived by others in a positive way.

*And my message on this is that you too can start doing a good job on teaching and spreading the Open Source word.
The only risk you are facing is to receive a very positive email like the above one!*
