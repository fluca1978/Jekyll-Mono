Another little improvement to my personal statistical data analyzer for Jekyll blogs.



# Jekyll Simple Stats exploits Terminal::ANSIColor

A further little improvement to my own Raku [application to create simple stats about how much do I blog](https://github.com/fluca1978/jekyll-simple-stats){:target="_blank"} on my Jekyll platform, named *Jekyll Simple Stats*, and implemented in Raku (aka Perl6).
<br/>
<br/>

The application now exploits `Terminal::ANSIColor` to provide some more nice output, with particular regard to sections to include (copy and paste).
<br/>
I've prepared a very simple video to demonstrate it in action.
