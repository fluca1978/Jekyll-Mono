A very nice surpise in the mail!

# PostgreSQL 12 Coin (by PGUS)

A couple of weeks ago I got a very nice surprise in the mail, but I was not able to write about it due to my eyes problems and  current situation (a very few details can be found [here](https://fluca1978.github.io/2020/06/29/PerlWeeklyChallenge67.html){:target="_blank"}).
<br/>
Anyway, promoting PostgreSQL is important, so here I am to tell you about what I received.
<br/>
<br/>
Long story short: **I received a PostgreSQL 12 celebrative coin!**

## The envelope

First of all, I clearly recognized the name on the envelope: Mark Wong is the treasurer of the [PostgreSQL US organization, namely *PGUS*](https://postgresql.us/){:target="_blank"}.

## The content

The content of the evenlope was **an amazing PostgreSQL 12 coin** and a couple of the PostgreSQL 12 press kit.
I've took a picture of the coin near a pen, in order to let you understand the size.

## The mission

PostgreSQL has been an important part of my life so far.
<br/>
I'm not a developer, but I started using it and being productive with it at work.
<br/>
Then I organized conferences, seminars and co-funded the Italian PostgreSQL Users' Group (ITPUG), from which I literally escaped in 2016 due to clashes with the management.
<br/>
Today I'm a PostgreSQL consultant.
<br/>
Therefore, I can say that PostgreSQL has always been a part, even if sometime marginal, of my working career. But this is not my mission, nor is that of the community.
<br/>
Our mission, as volounteers, is to improve PostgreSQL depending on our capabilities and *to spread the word*, to let other professional and passionate people embrace this database and get inspired by it.
<br/>
<br/>
This coin is an important sign, as other promotional material, in doing our mission and reminds me (and us) how important it is to make PostgreSQL a *famous* product even with non-technical stuff.


## 2019-10-03

It is interesting to note that the very next days of the release of PostgreSQL 12 I was in Rome, doing a professional course on PostgreSQL (of course!).
If my memory serves me well, it was October the 7th.

## PostgreSQL 13

No, it's not a typo: PostgreSQL 13 is almost here, but I'm equally glad to have this *piece of art*.


# Conclusions

I would like to thank the [PGUS](https://postgresql.us/){:target="_blank"} for sending me the coin, that I take as both a reminder on how important is to promote PostgreSQL and that I could have done some of the mission to promote it and get *awarded* with this, even if the award could be completly made up in my mind (so please let me believe I'm right!).
<br/>
<br/>
Being this a very hard time of my life, due to my eyes, it is somehow a relief knowing, or better being reminded, that **we are all part of an amazing community**.
