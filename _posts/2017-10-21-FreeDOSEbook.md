The [FreeDOS team has released a free ebook](http://www.freedos.org/ebook/)  with contributions about people that described their experience.

## FreeDOS ebook
-----

[FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org/) is surely not the operating system you *need* to run on your desktop, but it is a great effort in implementing a DOS-compatible operating system.

Why should you use FreeDOS? Well, allow me to explain why I seldom run FreeDOS.
It is because of those 20-years old C programs I wrote in school and that I like to execute.
It is because of that old DOS game (do you remember *Duke Nukem 3D*?).
It is because of that rotten machine laying out in the basement sending out faxes with an old DOS program...oh wait, I describe this true example in my *small chapter* in the ebook (see it on *page 14*).

[Go get the free ebook](http://www.freedos.org/ebook/) and find yourself the path to FreeDOS!
