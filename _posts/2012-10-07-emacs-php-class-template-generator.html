<div style="text-align: justify;">I use GNU Emacs as my default for a lot of stuff, including developing in PHP. Unluckily the great <i>php-mode</i> does not include a lot of common stuff to handle with OOP PHP programming. So I decided to develop a <a href="https://github.com/fluca1978/fluca1978-coding-bits/blob/master/emacs-lisp/fluca1978-php.el">PHP class template generator</a>, a lisp function that prompts for the class name (that will be capitalized and will be stored in a file with the same name) and for an optional comment, and then generates a class skeleton in a new buffer, saving the result to a file. Actually there are two versions of the function, the base one <i>php-class</i> executes the other <i>php-class-in-path</i> with the current working directory as path. The path is used to let Emacs know where to save the new buffer. In both cases, if a file with that name is already existent, the function aborts.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, calling <i>M-x php-class</i> and inserting a class name will make a new buffer appearing, with the class skeleton and a new file with such class will be saved.</div>
