I attented the last *Italian C++ Day* in Modena. Here's my short report about it.

# Italian C++ Day Modena
-----

Last saturday I spent a few hours attending the **[Italian C++ Day](http://www.italiancpp.org/event/cppday17/)** in Modena.

I have to say it was really a nice event, and most important, a very stimulating one.

While it is surely true I don't develop any C++ code since a few years, and therefore I'm a little un-trained in reading such code, I really appreciated the contents and the speakers that seemed to me enough professional and clear for even a non-C++ coder to listen. The topics, despite the titles, were really interesting.

A particular note on the organization, that was really informal and therefore much more stimulating than other more "business-style" events. Last but not least, the whole conference was for free, surely allowing other people to get in touch with the language and the community.

As a note, I believe the speakers were a little too slow on introducing each one her subject, lacking therefore time on the "hot" part of the speech. But beside this, I repeat the conference was really worth of!
