<div style="text-align: justify;">For one reason or the other, my jobs always required the development of Java applications. I was used to work with Borland JBuilder, and the main reasons were it was simple but powerful and did not waste&nbsp; megabytes or RAM making me wait more than 30 seconds to start and be fully functional. Nevertheless, it had some limitations, and so I was thinking to switch to a more complex and heavy environment, in particular NetBeans.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Then, at the 2002 PPPJ in Kilkenny, I attended the keynote speech of Mr. Vivek Sarkar that was at that time employed at IBM and therefore presented Eclipse 2. After the speech, while having a coffee, I asked what were the differences between Eclipse and NetBeans and why use one instead of the other. The main reason I got was the code refactoring, so once at home I installed Eclipse and tried it on my code base. At glance I did not like it: it was too heavy and complex, with too many functions and windows and tabs and other annoying stuff (I'm a terminal guy...). But the code refactoring was really impressive and I found it really useful.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So I started using Eclipse for my day-to-day development.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today it is still my Java default IDE, and I have noticed that a lot of people use it as a kind of fancy editor with autocompletion, without using some of the more interesting features like run configurations and Mylin.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In one of my previous job I had to create a client-server Java application that should have been really fast to run on Microsoft Windows and Apple machines. So I thought it was time for giving a try to SWT, the IBM Java toolkit Eclipse is based on.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">From SWT to Eclipse RCP the jump was fast and great, and therefore I started developing applications using Eclipse RCP v3.</div>
