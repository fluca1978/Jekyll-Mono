I'm preparing another short course on PostgreSQL, this time online with written material.


# PostgreSQL BSD Magazine course ebook is now available!
I've completed the material for the [BSD Magazine](http://bsdmag.org) [PostgreSQL intermediate course](https://bsdmag.org/course/course-10-improve-your-postgresql-skills/) and a final ebook has been produced and is available for purchase: **[Improve your PostgreSQL Skills ebook](https://bsdmag.org/product/improve-your-postgresql-skills-course-ebook/)**.

If you missed the course and want to get the material, including exercises and solutions, you can buy the ebook form the [BSD Magazine Web Site](https://bsdmag.org/product/improve-your-postgresql-skills-course-ebook/).

In the case you do purchase the ebook, please send me a feedback to allow me and the magazine to improve a possible future version.

And if you are guessing, all the written material has been produced using *Emacs org-mode* against a PostgreSQL 10.3 database.
