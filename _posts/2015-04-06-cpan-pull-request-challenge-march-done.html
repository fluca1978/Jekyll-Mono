<div style="text-align: justify;">Even if my March PR was not very complicated, it was succesfully <a href="https://github.com/shootnix/Mojolicious-Plugin-AnyData/pull/7#event-268503865">merged on time for my issue</a>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I have to admit that, due to personal duties, I was not able to contribute very much to the last assignment. So I applied the <i>Perl way of doing it</i> to the existing code resulting in removing a few unnecessary statements and conditions to the module.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Enough to keep on contributing to very good code and stay tuned in the Perl world.</div>
