I discovered that the epoch is not what I thought it was!

# What is your Epoch?

While developing an application to handle *Microsoft Excel* files, I had a trouble in converting timestamp columns to *practical* values (i.e., dates in my applications).
<br/>
I then searched for a solution in the source code of a module I'm using, [`SimpleXLS`](https://github.com/shuchkin/simplexls/blob/master/src/SimpleXLS.php#L1144), and the comment on that line puzzled me:

<br/>
```
Dates in Excel are stored as number of seconds from an epoch.  On
Windows, the epoch is 30/12/1899 and on Mac it's 01/01/1904
```

<br/>
What?
<br/>
Is the epoch something different from what I was used to think about? And to be honest, being grown as a Unix devotee, I thought it was a `time(2)` clearly states:

```shell
% man 2 time
...
DESCRIPTION
       time() returns the time as the number of seconds since 
       the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
```

<br/>
So, according to Unix, and POSIX, **Epoch is set at 1970-01-01**, while according to **proprietary software** it is not. Somehow this does not suprise me at all!
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I searched a little more, and according to this [Wikipedia Page on Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)) it seems there are a lot of different *epochs* around the world.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the human nature: we cannot agree on religions, why should we agree on times?
