<h1>~</h1>


<div style="text-align: justify;">I found a quite interesting blog that has a few articles about Emacs, my favourite editor. However, I was disappointed to see that one of such articles was referring to a porno web site.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The article was showing an image of Emacs displaying, in turn, an image of a girl wearing a swimsuit, so nothing really scaring...</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I thought she was a model. The article continued discussing how to enable Emacs loading and displaying multi media files, and assumed the user has a collection of the shown girl's video files. I was not aware of who the girl was (oh my!), but luckily the references at the end of the article provided a link to her official web site. As I wrote, I was thinking she was a model, and therefore I clicked the link and immediatly the traffic cop of my employeer blocked my web request.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Not so bad, commercial traffic cops usually get wrong on a lot of web sites and contents.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I totally forgot the incident and the web site.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">After a few days, while surfing the web at home, I picked up again the Emacs article and therefore decided to click again on the above web site to discover who the miss really is.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Well, she is a porn star!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Now I'm angry.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">While using top model images is fine for me, I believe that using and redirecting readers to porn sites is totally wrong. Moreover, I don't want my employeer to record even a single click by myself against a porn site, and in fact I never browse sites that are not technical in nature when at work.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As readers can imagine, I'm not posting any backlink to the original article, neither I'm going to provide the name of the porn star here.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">What is really fun, is that I was thinking to collaborate with the blog author to make some more complete articles about Emacs.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Sorry pal, you loose an opportunity!</div><br /><br />
