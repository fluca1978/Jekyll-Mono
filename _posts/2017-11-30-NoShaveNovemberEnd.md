This year, no money, sorry pals, I tried.

# End result for me
-----

I'm at the end of the second year in a row of [*No Shave November*](https://no-shave.org/), an interesting  initiative to grow cancer awareness.

So what is the end result for me?

Well, unluckily [I was unable to raise my fund bar](https://no-shave.org/member/fluca1978), but I tried harder than the previous year.
This will not stop me in trying again the next year.

But wait, what about the *let them grow* part? Here it is the ending of the month:
