<div style="text-align: justify;">I had a little time to study one of my favorite Perl too: <a href="https://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew</a>.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">While reading the source code I decided to add a little extra-information on the output of the <i>available</i> command. Such command provides the list of available (i.e., downloadable) Perl versions, but not from where it is going to download them.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Therefore I applied a patch to show to the outer world the donadloadable links.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">And after a few days and a little embarassement for a forgotten failing test, it has been <a href="https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/pull/542#event-949040778">merged</a>!</div>
