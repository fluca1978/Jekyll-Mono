I've signed the petition to boycott Trend Micro, that has sued Barracuda Networks for a patent right issue based on the use of the latter of the Open-Source GPL Clam AV antivirus software.<br /><blockquote><br />I'd like to express my support to Barracuda Networks, that is exploiting a GPL product accordingly to its licence, and so in a regular way. I also would like to applaud Barracuda for informing the community about its legal problems, a thing that probably Trend Micro didn't think could happen.<br />I cannot believe that someone could be sued due to patent rights on open source and GPL code, and this is an example of the need for a stronger protection against patents (like GPLv3 does), as well as it represents a nightmare for the open source community.<br />Moreover, I cannot really see the point in scanning a file travelling into a network, especially when this is done with an open source product. And if there is really a patent right, who will protect us againt viruses? Patent right holders? That's sound ridiculous to me!</blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br /></span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="ttp://www.scriptumlibre.org/Boycott_Trend_Micro"><br /><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yhEX77VFKnM/R8FyR3_FsHI/AAAAAAAAACU/h5BxuhvNEgo/s320/boycott_trend_micro_234-60.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5170539498609946738" border="0" /><br /></a>
