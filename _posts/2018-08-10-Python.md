I never wrote a row of Python, until...

# Is it me writing in Python?

I have already [written about it](https://fluca1978.github.io/2018/08/07/PostgreSQL-pgxnclient-patch.html): a few days ago I wrote a little tiny stupid patch for `pgxn`, a Python tool that helps managin PostgreSQL extensions.

After a couple of more days, I have written some other little pieces of Python for the same utility command:
- [getting the vesion number out of PostgreSQL](https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pgxnclient/pull/30)
- [handling I/O and permission problems on the filesystem](https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pgxnclient/pull/31)

As you can see, this does not make me a **Python developer**, and I do still consider myself a Python idiot. However, for the very first time, I wrote some piece of Python that is not an *Hello World* program!

I cannot give any impression on the language from such pieces of code, however I can state that is surely nicer than PHP.
