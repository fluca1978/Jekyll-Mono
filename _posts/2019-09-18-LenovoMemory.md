Well, the Thinkpad 410 has a strange location for the memory!

# Upgrading RAM on my Lenovo Thinkpad T410

I still use a **Lenovo Thinkpad 410** as my main computer when travelling and teaching. It works fine, it is fast enough and has the video output I need.
<br/>
So far, so good!
<br/>
However, since in my training session I tend to use a couple of virtual machine to demonstrate concepts, I decided to upgrade my `4 GB` RAM to the maximum supported **`8 GB`**.
<br/>
As a surprise, when I opened the RAM slot I found only a stick for a total size of `2 GB`, so where was the other one?
It took me a while to understand that **the second memory stick is under the keyboard**:

So if you have the very same Lenovo model, please take into account that a memory upgrade is not as simple as it is on other laptops.
<br/>
Anyway, now my Lenovo has a full power of `8 GB`, and that's fine to run Linux hosting a couple of PostgreSQL virtual machines! Think about when your only operating system is asking for the total RAM!
