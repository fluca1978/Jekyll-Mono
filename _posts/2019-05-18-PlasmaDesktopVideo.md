Not a very interesting post, but a brief video showing how I tend to keep light my desktop!

# A brief look at my desktop

I'm not one an *all-on-desktop* icons man, I tend to keep my desktop very clean and minimal because I switch between applications that are all at the maximum size.
<br/>
I keep my *most frequently used* applications at my findertips, on the panel, but on the right because I'm supposed to click on them only once, and therefore I prefer to keep my left part of the panel with the task manager. Recently I switched from the usual task manager to an icon only one, which makes the panel look a lot more empty.
<br/>
I do use a few tridimensional effects when switching among windows, mostrly because they give me time to think about which window I'm actually switching to.
<br/>
And there's Emacs, today *Spacemacs*, with the wonderful `magit` extension.
