<div style="text-align: justify;">I had the opportunity and pleasure to play an active role in the third ITPUGLab, a well established tradition and a successful event me and my friend Gianluca proposed a few years ago.<br />And I have to say: it was really fun and educative.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">What is the ITPUGLab? In short: it is an Open Space container entirely focused on PostgreSQL.<br />Attendees meet for exchanging, proposing or requesting ideas, thoughts, approaches and experiences getting 'hands-on' in a LAN environment and building a constructive shared experience on their laptops, or even philosophical discussions of any kind all being user-experience centric and related to PostgreSQl. No matter what the participants' skill level is.<br />There are no predefined contents: attendees come and propose or join others' proposals.<br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The evolution of the shared interactive contributions is what leads to discovering a path (not necessarily the right one) and get to a possible goal.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This translates to human-networking with a&nbsp; PostgreSQL-social approach, allowing attendees to get acquainted in ways one cannot predict. </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">This year we had two and half hours dedicated to the lab, a very comfortable room and very nice people attending.<br /><br />The following is the list of topics discussed end experienced:</div><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>installation on Microsoft Windows, where the users challenged the differences on installing PostgreSQL on a Unix-unlike machine, coming to the goal of providing a running instance to other people in the room;</li><li>migration and upgrade, with particular interest to the migration of a quite old cluster from a MS Windows machine to a mature and up-to-date cluster on a *nix machine, as well how to do it automatically and error-safely;</li><li>install, configure and use the PostGIS extension from scratch;</li><li>pl/pgsql scripting, with particular focus on editors, repos and best practices;</li><li>data integrity check and validation with regard to the database and/or application;</li><li>periodical data dump and load from one server to one (or many) others, with regard to various scenarios and possible automations.</li></ul><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Rules in the ITPUGLab are simple: after introducing themselves, participants start grouping spontaneously, warm up and get discussing, hands-on. Everybody can join a formed OpenSpace as well as leave it or, even, the room. When it's over, it's over: once the time elapsed pencil are down, and what happened is always the only and rightmost thing could happened.<br />Pictures cannot provide the excitement and fun filling the room.</div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3LQDwXyBOws/ViuMFIipcWI/AAAAAAAADWc/ypm80u6_HpA/s1600/DSC00552.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3LQDwXyBOws/ViuMFIipcWI/AAAAAAAADWc/ypm80u6_HpA/s320/DSC00552.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FW3NDrTYUTY/ViuMKeUIDMI/AAAAAAAADWk/kqjq14bQVnI/s1600/DSC00549.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FW3NDrTYUTY/ViuMKeUIDMI/AAAAAAAADWk/kqjq14bQVnI/s320/DSC00549.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NLfNeRgA64Y/ViuMQkhPNKI/AAAAAAAADWs/f34snLtmmK0/s1600/DSC00553.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NLfNeRgA64Y/ViuMQkhPNKI/AAAAAAAADWs/f34snLtmmK0/s320/DSC00553.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ElZhjDYuC5A/ViuMT0qoZUI/AAAAAAAADW0/as2H-o5-8JI/s1600/DSC00554.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ElZhjDYuC5A/ViuMT0qoZUI/AAAAAAAADW0/as2H-o5-8JI/s320/DSC00554.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">As said, this is the third edition of the ITPUGLab, and quite frankly I'm proud of the continuous success it is getting within the PGDay.IT annual conference.<br />One thing all the three edition did have in common is the same request by attendees for more time: we are evaluating how to extend the session in the next PGDay.IT.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">If you are coming to the next PGDay.IT, get into the lab: it's an experience you really don't want to miss!</div>
