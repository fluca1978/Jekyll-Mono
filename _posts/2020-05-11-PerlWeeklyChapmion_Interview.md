I was selected as winner for the April 2020 month.

# Perl Weekly Challenge: Champion of the Month April 2020

I am being elected as champion for *April 2020* in the great and fun [Perl Weekly Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/){:target="_blank"}. As a consequence of this, I have [been shortly interviewed](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/meet-the-champion-2020-04/){:target="_blank"} by the PWC main lead Mohammad.

It has been nice to both win the month challenge and be interviewed. I strongly believe that challenges as the [Perl Weekly Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/){:target="_blank"} can help you not only in becoming a better programmer, but also in keeping your mind trained and let other people see and evaluate your progresses, building a concrete *portfolio* of solutions.
