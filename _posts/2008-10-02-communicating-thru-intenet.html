It's amazing how easy communicating thru Internet is. Just as an example yesterday I got a contact from Rick McKinney, an archer myth for myself! This is just the last important and/or famous person I met thru Internet, and in fact in the past I got contact with a lot of important developers (from PostgreSQL to Samba and Linux....).<br />This is one of the things I like the most about Internet: it does not matter who you are or what you do, you can always and easily meet people you only heard about!
