My own first book on PostgreSQL is gaining more and more attention, and this is agood news.

PostgreSQL 11 Server Side Programming it's gaining attention
---

I'm happy to say that my very first book on PostgreSQL, **[PostgreSQL 11 Server Side Programming Quick Start Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/postgresql-11-server-side-programming-quick-start-guide)**, is gaining more and more attention and the statistics about it is increasing.

<br/>
Quite frankly, the book sold one order of magnitude more than I was expecting and it is still raising even if PostgreSQL 12 is the latest major version and 13 is almost here.
<br/>


<br/>
I think the dramatical situation around europe, and more in general the world, namely *COVID-19* is also responsible for this raising: since people is forced to stay at home, one that keep mind occupied is to read and study other topics and subjects.
<br/>
Me myself have started reading technical books I never thought I would have read in normal conditions.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to the book, please consider that even if the title includes *11* as version, many of the examples and guidelines can be applied in newer versions of PostgreSQL. I have to admit I'm using many of the examples in my **training events and courses** (I can, of course, being the author).
<br/>
The book uses Perl and Java as the main foreign languages, being of course PL/PgSQL the main *native* language for the application development.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can enjoy the book during this particular point in time.
<br/>
And if you have some suggestions or errata-corridge, please advice and I will include credits and details in the book code repository.
