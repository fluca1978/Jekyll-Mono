`tar(1)` is probably one of the most frequently used command by any Unix sysadmin. But the BSD version has a lot of features hidden to Linux users!

# As powerful as tar(1) is ...

Readin the `tar(1)` man page (because you, as I do, sometimes re-read man pages, right?) I found that the BSD version, in particular the FreeBSD version, of `tar(1)` does support a lot more file layouts.
<br/>
GNU `tar(1)` supports the following compressed formats:
- `bzip2(1)`
- `xz(1)`
- `lzip(1)`
- `lzma(1)`
- `lzop(1)`
<br/>
while the FreeBSD version supports **also**:
- `zstd`
- `lrzip(1)`
- `lz4`
<br/>
but here is more than just compression. BSD `tar(1)` also provides *native* support for `iso9660` (disk images) and encryption!
<br/>
Since `tar(1)` is shipped with the base system, seems FreeBSD has access to a lot more archive formats than regular GNU distributions.
