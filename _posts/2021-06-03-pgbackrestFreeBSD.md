pgbackrest has been inserted into the FreeBSD ports!

# pgbackrest lands on FreeBSD!

At last it happened: [pgbackrest, my **favourite backup solution fo PostgreSQL**](https://pgbackrest.org/){:target="_blank"} is now [available in the FreeBSD ports tree](https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=c49969ef4f68de362c260f7822e212c8045f7e6a){:target="_blank"}, my favourite operating system!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the efforts of people involved in [this issue](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/issues/1293){:target="_blank"} it is now possible to get pgbackrest installed *easily* (or in a simpler way) on FreeBSD!
