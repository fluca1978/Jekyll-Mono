I'm proud when my efforts, as small as they are, are recognized publicly!

# Working on Perl 6 documentation

In the last couple of months I did spent some time in improving the [Perl 6 documentation](https://docs.perl6.org).
Well, I have to admit it is
[always worth receiving a public recognition about your efforts](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1731#issuecomment-360715687): thanks!
