Yesterday it was my last session at the local Linux Users' Group ConoscereLinux course on PostgreSQL. Since the LUG gave me the chance to deliver an extra session, and since all the attendees were fun and nice, I decide to "contribute back".

# `pg_chocolate`

No, this is not a new project about our favourite database.
<br/>
I asked my great wife to make a chocolate cake to share with all attendees, and we came up with the idea of putting the elephant logo on top of it.

<br/>
Let's say it was not difficult for my wife to produce the elephant cake, that bite after bite disappeared...you know, even complex queries become simpler in front of a good cake!
Chances are there will be a /replication/ instance coming up sooner or later!
