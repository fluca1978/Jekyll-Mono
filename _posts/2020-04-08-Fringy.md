My wife asked me a small and quick application to manage some articles. And here's what I did.

Building an application quickly: the Perl way!
---
kMy wife asked me a simple and quick application to manage a little warehouse where she is currently working. 
<br/>
What to use? How to write it?
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to use **Perl** and **Catalyst**, in order to build a simple web application. I have to admit it has been years since I wrote my last Catalyst based application, and in the last month I've written much more in Raku than in Perl.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was able to design and implement the application in a weekend, and that was not me being good, rather **Catalyst**, **DBIc** and **Perl** being the right set of tools to do this. And thanks to my old friend **SQLite3**, I didn't need a relation engine to install and setup!
<br/>
<br/>
The end result was named *Fringy*, credits to our last dog.
<br/>
<br/>
I then spent more than one day in styling, and that's because I don't like CSS at all!
<br/>
<br/>
*I've also started to hate more and more Java and Hibernate: if you have ever tried *DBIc* you know what I'm talking about!*
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I cannot share any code so far, I've not setup a remote repository but surely I will do once I know exactly what it will be the future of this small piece of code.
