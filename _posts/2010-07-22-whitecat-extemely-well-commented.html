<div style="text-align: justify;">According to the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">Ohloh</a> code metrics, WhiteCat is <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/whitecat/factoids/3497896"><i>extremely well commented</i></a>: comments are at 62% of the project and this makes WhiteCat in the first 10% Java projects in Ohloh for code comments.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Well, this does not mean that WhiteCat is a good system, but that its development has been done (until now) in a very disciplined way. And this is particularly importan for OpenSource projects, because a good and clean documentation helps new users/developers to join the project itself.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The following is the quote from the Ohloh site:</div><br /><blockquote>       Across all Java projects on Ohloh,       32% of       all source code lines are comments. For WhiteCat, this figure is       61%.       <br />This very impressive number of comments puts WhiteCat among the  top 10% of all Java projects on Ohloh.       <br /></blockquote>
