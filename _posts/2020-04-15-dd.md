Something I discovered by accident.

# dd(1) and JCL

The `dd(1)` command is very common utility in Unix systems, used to write images, files and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
But where does the name *dd* comes from?
<br/>
I thought it came from something like **d**ata **d**umper or something like that. I was wrong!
<br/>
I discovered the name comes from the [worst language ever implemented](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks){:target="_blank"}: **JCL** or *Job Control Language*.
<br/>
<br/>
[JCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Control_Language){:target="_blank"}, in fact, includes a directive to define a source for data named **`DD`**, that in turn is a directive for a *dataset*, a fancy name for a file.
<br/>
Last, `dd` [copies its name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)){:target="_blank"} from the `DD` directive, and also jokes on that! As usual, Unix is more than operating system, *it's a culture*!
