I spent some time fixing some errors.

# Refactoring my blog stats generator

I've spent a couple of hours improving my personal Perl 5 script to generate Jekyll blog statistics. Since [version 67aa9eb of *Jekyll Simple Stats*](https://github.com/fluca1978/jekyll-simple-stats/commit/67aa9ebd74b5a0f8c95111d8add55209d997931c) there are a few little improvements and fixes that I discovered when the year turned to *2020*. Yes, changing the year was good because I had pretty much no posts in the new year (this one is the very second) and therefore a couple of wrong *counting* within the script shown up.
<br/>
Now the script handles correctly the abscence of either posts or tags within a graph (Perl's **autovivification** is really a great way to handle the abscence of data!), provides a better grid and centers the tics with months. I have to admit that my *Gnuplot* knowledge is really at a low level, therefore suggestions and improvements are really welcome.
<br/>

<br/>
Of course, [this blog stats](/stats) have been updated consequently.
