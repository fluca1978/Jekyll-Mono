The <a href="http://2016.pgday.it/">PgDay.IT 2016</a> is approaching and the schedule is available on line <a href="http://2016.pgday.it/en/pages/schedule.html">here</a>. Of course it could be subject to some little changes, but it is pretty mich a complete list of what you are going to see at the tenth edition of the PostgreSQL Italian Day.<br /><br />
