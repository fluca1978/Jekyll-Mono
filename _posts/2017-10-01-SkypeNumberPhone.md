How Skype locked my account for change with my personal phone number...

## Skype and my personal phone number...
-----

A few days ago I had to use Skype again, after several years, in order to talk with a few friends of mine.
I did had an account, but I was not really diligent and I did not remember well all details (password, attached email, and so on)
so I decided to create a new account. After all, since I was not using Skype for several years, it was not a big deal to change
identity on it.

So far so good: a couple of minutes after I was already logged in and using Skype.

After three or four days, I had to sign in again to make a call, but Skype refuses to let me log in stating I have to
contact Microsoft account server to gain details about what was going wrong.
And so I did.
With surprise, Microsoft was claiming that my fresh account was generating too much spam, and has been locked accordingly.
Uhm, how can I generate spam without having connected to any Microsoft-service? Strange, but hey, this is Microsoft, so
*I bindly believed they are doing the right thing* and asked for unlocking my account.

In order to get unlocked you need to insert a randomly generated numeric code that has to be sent only via SMS.
**Wait a minute: I never told to Skype (and therefore to Microsoft) what my personal phone number was**, so how could they
send me an SMS? Easy pal: **I had to provide my personal phone number** so that I can get my account unlocked, and yes, there was
no other option available!

Therefore, to recap:
1. I got a new Skype account;
2. after a couple of days my account was locked without any evidence of producing any bit of spam;
3. I had to provide my personal phone number in order to get Skype working again.

**It does sound to me like a strategy to get my personal phone number**, and of course **it was not a secure way of unlocking
an account** since an attacker could have stolen my password and provide his own phone number.

I would like to get some advice from other Skype users about what happened to me, that is clearly [not something strictly related to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1luf3v/skype_tells_me_to_give_my_phone_number_which_i/).

And I'm waiting for some spam on my phone...
