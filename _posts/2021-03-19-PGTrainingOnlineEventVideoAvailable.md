# PgTraining online webinar  2021-03-12 (Italian): video available

[PgTraining](http://pgtraining.com){:target="_blank"}, the amazin italian group of people that spread the word about PostgreSQL and that I joined in the last years, has organized an online **free event** (*webinar*) on last April the 12th, 2021.
<br/>
There were around 45 participants, that was quite a success in our opinion for such a small event. Most notably, the participants were really interested in the topics covered and, in fact, we got a lot of live questions and were unable to close the session in time since the discussion was really active!
<br/>
We made  video recordings for the event available, or better *off line video recording* because we decided not to live record the event due to privacy concerns. All the videos are in *italian language*.
Here there is my talk, **pgbackrest as a backup solution**:
