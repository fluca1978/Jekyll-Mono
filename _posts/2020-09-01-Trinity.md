KDE is still alive and in good shape!

# Trinity Desktop (do you remember KDE 3?)

I discovered today a project named [Trinity Desktop](http://www.trinitydesktop.org/){:target="_blank"}, that is based on KDE 3 and is producing a functional desktop environment.

I do remember when I was working at university and it took me almost three days to compile a fully working KDE 3 (I guess it was 3.0) desktop on my own laptop. And I remember how I has always been amazed by the beauty and usability of such a desktop.
<br/>
Later on, KDE became *Plasma* and the overhaul to version 4 was something hard. I religiously followed the transition, but it was hard to use the first releases when compared to the fully functional KDE 3.
<br/>
I'm not saying that I'm going to switch back to [Trinity Desktop](http://www.trinitydesktop.org/){:target="_blank"}, but it could be interesting to give it a try. There are [Ubuntu images](http://mirror.ppa.trinitydesktop.org/trinity/cdimages/ubuntu/){:target="_blank"} as well as images for other distributions.

<br/>
The good news is that it is supported (almost) on FreeBSD too!


## Testing it on a virtual machine

Do you remember the **keramik** theme? It was one of my favourites!

I donwloaded an Ubuntu image and give Trinity a run, and it was really a jump into the past to me and the good old days of KDE 3 desktop and the behavior I liked in Linux more than in other operating systems.


It is clear that Trinity tries to provide a customizable user experience since at the first start the user is asked for a desktop behavior (I don't remember KDE 3 having such a behavior, but I could be wrong), or the theming.

and finally the **TDE** desktop is up and running, and **KDE** appears again!
