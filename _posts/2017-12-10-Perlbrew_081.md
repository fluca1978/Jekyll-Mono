A new version of Perlbrew is out: version 0.81!. And I contributed to this version (and it's my second contribution to releases of this package).

# perlbrew 0.81 is out!

In the last few days a new version of [perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl) has been released, and a few contributions were made during my [Hacktoberfest](https://fluca1978.github.io/2017/10/31/Hacktoberfest.html).
This is the second time I do contribute to the project, and both releases including my bits included patches from Hacktoberfest:

- in 2016, the very first time I took courage and (contribute to the project)[https://github.com/gugod/www.perlbrew.pl/blob/master/public/Release-0.79.html];
- in 2017, (improving much more the code base and features)[https://github.com/gugod/www.perlbrew.pl/blob/master/public/Release-0.81.html].

I do care about this project, that I use every day in my command line, and that's why I tried to improve it.
