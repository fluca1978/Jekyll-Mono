<div style="text-align: justify;">I attended the <a href="http://2013.eurobsd.org/">Euro BSD 2013 </a>in Malta, on the last week of September.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The conference was a great mix of technical and social knowledge and represents a great opportunity to meet, talk and learn directly from the /Unix-gods/ of any time and nation. For instance, I was sitting near the legendary <i>McKusick</i> while listening the great <i>Theo De Raadt</i> during his keynote about the <i>time_t</i> overflow problem.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had the great opportunity to see and meet people I've only seen as names on mailing lists, and the technical quality of many of the talks was really good. Several talks were related to the [[http://www.openbsd.org][OpenBSD]] project, and I have to say I'm every day more interested in this project more for its policy than for its technology; but this is another story.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had nothing but good words to say about the event and the organization, and definetely was worth being there.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had also the opportunity to visit (again) Malta, which is a very nice place to be and to spend a few days.</div>
