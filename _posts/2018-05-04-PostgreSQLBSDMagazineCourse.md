I'm preparing another short course on PostgreSQL, this time online with written material.


# PostgreSQL online course via BSD Magazine
[BSD Magazine](http://bsdmag.org) is delivering a [PostgreSQL intermediate course](https://bsdmag.org/course/course-10-improve-your-postgresql-skills/) with my own material.

I've been writing articles for [BSD Magazine](http://bsdmag.org) for a lot now, and many of them with the *PostgreSQL* subject, so according with the editors, we decided to create a full course with **5 modules** and *written material* to allow readers to get a more detailed view on PostgreSQL capabilities.

<br/>
<br/>
The course will be performed by presenting attendees written material with examples, exercises and offering online support for doubts and questions. This course is an *intermediate* one, meaning it will not cover basic concepts like installation, SQL basic statements, `psql` and connection strings, and so on. The topic list is available on the [course page](https://bsdmag.org/course/course-10-improve-your-postgresql-skills/).

<br/>
<br/>
I would like to thank [BSD Magazine](http://bsdmag.org) editors for the great opportunity to spread again the word of PostgreSQL!
