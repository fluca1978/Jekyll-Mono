I discovered a new web browser based on QtWebKit: *Qupzilla*

# Qupzilla
-----
Today I discovered a new web browser named *[Qupzuilla](https://www.qupzilla.com/)* and based on the QtWebKit. The browser aims at being fast, secure and extendible. I've installed and fired up and it looks very promising, and the project seems to be enough mature (being developed since 2010), as well as it is now integrated as far as I understand into the KDE repository.

Qupzilla does reminds me the *[Rekonq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rekonq)* web broswer, even if the former seems a little more portable than the latter. This is also demonstrated in the [wikipedia comparison chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_lightweight_web_browsers).

Being more portable, I believe I will give Qupzilla a try on my home machine!
