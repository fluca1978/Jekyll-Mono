Today I hit the 200th commit on the *Perl 6 Documentation* project.
Nothing special, but I'm glad to be part of such project.

# Improving the Perl 6 Documentation

Today I hit [commit number 200](https://github.com/perl6/doc/graphs/contributors) on the [Perl 6 Documentation Project](https://github.com/perl6/doc). I don't think this is particularly special, but at the same time represents my will to push back to the *great* community some effort.
It is also a demonstration of both the need for improvement in the documentation and my constant passion for learning and teaching.
