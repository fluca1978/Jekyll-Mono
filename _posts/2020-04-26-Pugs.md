While reading (again) and old programming book I found a reference at PUGS!

# Who remember PUGS?

Todays was a nice sunny day, so I decided to spend the afternoon in my garden staring at the sun reading my programming book on the kindle.
<br/>
While reading an old book, on *Ruby* (because we need to know everything, right?), I found a reference to [Pugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs_(programming){:target="_blank"}, the *initial* effort in implementing Perl 6 (now *Raku*).

[Pugs](https://github.com/perl6/Pugs.hs){:target="_blank"} was a Perl 6 implementation done in Haskell, and its name stands for *Perl 6 User's Golfing System (PUGS)*. Nowdays is, as you can imagine, a piece of history, but back in the days it was very useful because provided a good workbench for the Perl 6 specification and offered several implementation ideas.

<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if the author sentence is right, and Pugs has drawn more attention to Haskell than to Perl 6, but I know for sure it was an important piece of the history of Perl 6 as we know it today.

<br/>
The book was the nice  *Ruby by Example: Using Ruby to Solve Difficult Problems* by Baird, Kevin C., which I read a few years agow hen I was involved in a project related to Redmine and other Ruby based stuff.
