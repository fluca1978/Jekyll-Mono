My book about programming on the PostgreSQL side!

# PostgreSQL 11 Server Side Programming - Quick Start Guide
---

Yesterday my first commercial book in the PostgreSQL landscape was officially published: **[PostgreSQL 11 Server Side Programming Quick Start Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/postgresql-11-server-side-programming-quick-start-guide)!**

## Is this only about version 11?

The book code has been tested against version 11, but despite the title it is enough general to be used as a basis for pretty much any recent version of PostgreSQL. Of course, some parts cannot be executed on older versions, like for instance the *procedures* chapter. However, concepts and samples can be adapted also to older versions and are therefore enough general to get a good introduction to server side programming.

# What this book covers

This book is a *Quick Start Guide*, so it is a short book on a very specific subject, that means it will not teach you about PostgreSQL management in general, and assumes you are able to install, run and connect to a PostgreSQL 11 instance.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

The book starts with a chapter dedicated to *query tricks*: the usage of `UPSERT`, `RETURNING` and recursive `CTE` in order to take advantage of these PostgreSQL features when dealing with common day-to-day tasks.
<br/>
The the book shows how to use the `PL/pgSQL` language to write runnable code directly within a database connection. Unlike other books, that show such language by means of *functions*, I decided to use the `DO` construct to write and run *inline* code immediatly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

After that, the reader is ready to learn about `FUNCTION`s and `PROCEDURE`s, the latest new cool object from PostgreSQL 11: both allow you to store runnable code within the server and call it (i.e., run it) later on, but while the former (functions) cannot interact with transaction, the latter (procedures) can.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

One interesting and very cool feature of PostgreSQL is its capability to accept code written in pretty much any programming language out there, and therefore why not showing it to the reader? Therefore a chapter is dedicated to the **PL/Perl** and **PL/Java** languages. Why such languegs? Because one is a *script*-like language well supported by PostgreSQL, to the extent it can be executed even in a `DO` statement, the latter is compiled-like code that require more attention to be deployed and executed. The idea is therefore to present the reader with two possible concrete choices of languages to implement code, and reason about their capabilities and deployment. Of course, you could complain about *your favourite language* not being in the book, but if you think about, the deployment of Perl code is similar to the deployment of Python code, or Ruby, while Java is similar to the deployment of C#, or...you name it!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

With the foundation about the deployable code, it is then possible to implement *triggers*, and therefore a whole chapter is dedicated to them, including DDL triggers. And since triggers can sometimes be replaced by rules, and the latter are useful for other server-side programming stuff, a chapter is dedicated to *rules*.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Having learned about how to write code and deploy it, it is a good habit to package your code and mantain it. Luckily PostgreSQL provides *extensions* to the rescue, so the reader is presented with a guide about how to implement its own extension from scratch, as well as how to interact with the existent extension ecosystem (PGXN and PGXS).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

The last two chapter go a little more into details about PostgreSQL internals, showing how to interact among processes (`LISTEN` and `NOTIFY`), how to scratch a **Background Worker** and how to implement custom data types.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


I tried to keep the book within a pragmatic approach, showing common use cases and practical solutions. I really hope the book will meet the readers' wills!

## Lesson Learned

While writing a book is a long task, it can be fun. I don't want to minimize it, but it is surely a way to force yourself to explain concept you already know to someone else, therefore improving your knowledge on the subject. Furthermore, writing a book about something you care about, as it was for me, is really fun and satisfactory.


## This is not the only book on PostgreSQL I've written this year!

While this is surely *the book* in my professional year, there is also another small book made by lectures on PostgreSQL I've done in the past: see [the BSDMagazine Course Book Post](https://fluca1978.github.io/2018/06/20/PostgreSQL_Course_BSDMagazine_ebook.html).


## Spread the word!

Once the book has been made available, I did my best effort to make possible readers aware of it:
- posted an advertisement on PostgreSQL italian mailing lists;
- asked (and obtained) to get it listed in the [PostgreSQL official books page](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/books/)
[![PostgreSQL-11-ServerSideProgramming-books-page](/images/posts/pg11ssp/postgresql_org_books.png)](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/postgresql-11-server-side-programming-quick-start-guide)
- shared on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6474235349601120256/);
- shared on [blogs.perl.org](http://blogs.perl.org/users/luca_ferrari/2018/12/postgresql-11-server-side-programming---quick-start-guide.html) because, to some extent, it is related to Perl;
- my [old defunct blog](https://fluca1978.blogspot.com/2018/12/postgresql-11-server-side-programming.html) because it still has some feed aggregations somewhere.

If you know some places/audience to make aware about this book, please do it and inform me!
