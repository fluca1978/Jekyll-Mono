I found a very nice tool to use on my Plasma desktop to produce PDF documents starting from a range of other documents.

# Producing PDF the easy way: PDFQuirk

[PDF Quirk](https://dragotin.github.io/quirksite/){:target="_blank"} is a fresh and simple tools, and at the very same time a very powerful one, that is available as an application that runs on top of Qt 5 (and therefore, on Plasma too).
<br/>
The idea behind [PDF Quirk](https://dragotin.github.io/quirksite/){:target="_blank"} is that it is possible to produce a single PDF froma  list of images or other documents, something like what you can do with [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php){:target="_blank"} or similar tools. Effectively, this is just a front-end for the well know ImageMagick, so it exploits the same reliable technology.
<br/>
So where is the advantage of using PDF Quirk? An easy and clean GUI instead of having to deal with the command line. I'm not scare by the command line, and quite frankly is the only way I do my stuff, but I find it hard to remember how to merge documents into a single one, and therefore PDF Quirk is somehow a relief.
<br/>
On the command line I've to do something like the following:

```shell
% convert 'pre 1.jpg'  'pre 2.jpg'  'pre 3.jpg'  'pre 4.jpg'  'pre 5.jpg'  'pre 6.jpg'  'pre 7.jpg'  'pre 8.jpg' pre.pdf
```

that will merge all `pre` JPEG files into a single PDF.
<br/>
Now with PDF Quirk I can launch the GUI and add the images with `Add from File` button, that handles multiple selections, and then `Save` to get the progam asking for the output file to produce.

The [tool](https://github.com/dragotin/pdfquirk){:target="_blank"} is at a very early stage, but it is already useful to me (and probably to many others), and will get surely improved during time.
