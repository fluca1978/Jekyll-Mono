Making a scene as in the War Games film.

Simulating the WOPR (a tribute to professor Folken)
---
I was searching for an introductory video, for a project I'm thinking to start (and that is not that difficult to guess).
<br/>
I began using a specific `Konsole` profile to simulate somehow the old Commodore 64 typing experience.
<br/>
Then I remembered I knew about a *strange* project, named [Cool Retro Term CRT)](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term ){:target="_blank"}, that is a GUI based terminal emulator that adds a lot of fancy effects to mimic the old cathode computer monitors.
<br/>
I don't see myself using such a terminal on a day-by-day basis, but it can be nice to have it around just to remember the times where doing system administration was something literally blowing your eyes.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, using the *CRT* and my own [Perl script to simulate a real typing](https://github.com/fluca1978/fluca1978-coding-bits/blob/master/perl/slow_printer.pl ){:target="_blank"}, I was able to mimic the [WOPR, the self-thinking computer of the **War Games** film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXzNo0vR_dU){:target="_blank"}.
<br/>
<br/>
And here it is the final effect:
