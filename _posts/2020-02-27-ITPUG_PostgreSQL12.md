Apparently ITPUG is taking more time on publishing PostgreSQL news that the core team to develop new versions!

# ITPUG Website and PostgreSQL 12

**The *Italian PostgreSQL Users' Group (ITPUG)* is _less than awesome_ in managing its [web site](https://www.itpug.org){:target="_blank"}**.
<br/>
<br/>
On October 17, 2019, I noticed that the web site was missing a news about the (at that time) freshly released PostgreSQL 12, so *even if I don't approve the ITPUG way of managing things*, I thought that PostgreSQL could have had advantages in appearing in the timeline, and so I pushed [a pull request to fix the website](https://github.com/ITPUG/www.itpug.org/pull/32/commits/430c3571d656a7005fee22e7fe5053b2f6aefd23){:target="_blank"**.
<br/>
As you can imagine, it was as simple as a paragraph of text with a Markdown link to the official news.
<br/>
<br/>
The I forgot about.
<br/>
<br/>
Until I got an email in my inbox saying that the pull request was merged.
<br/>
**It was merged on February 17, 2020**, [here you can find it](https://github.com/ITPUG/www.itpug.org/pull/32){:target="_blank"}.

<br/>
Let's say: it's better having it the news that not having it at all.
<br/>
But quite frankly, how much time is supposed to take the merging of such a pull request?
<br/>
How much time are you spending to *promote PostgreSQL*? Let's recap:
- you don't update the web site with newer releases;
- the [most recent post on the blog is dated 2018](https://blog.itpug.org/Pycon9/){:target="_blank"};
- the [board is dated 2018](https://www.itpug.org/bacheca/){:target="_blank"};
- there has been a single commit in 2019, just to update the committee membership;
- there are [pull request frozen since 2018 and never merged, nor commented, nor rejected](https://github.com/ITPUG/www.itpug.org/pulls){:target="_blank"}

<br/>
*I really hope you guys will catch up and keep the website up-to-date in the future*.
<br/>
Having been a member of the directors, I know how hard it can be, and it is for that reason that the site has been moved to GitHub, so to promote also spontanous fixes. **So pelase don't waste other people time** and review any contribution that comes in.
