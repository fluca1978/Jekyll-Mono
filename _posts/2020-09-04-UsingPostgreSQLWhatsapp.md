A little contribution in spreading the PostgreSQL word!

# Hey there! I'm using PostgreSQL!

A few weeks ago I changed my old mobile phone, and so I had to install again all my applications, including something I personally hate: *WhatsApp*.
<br/>
While checking the configuration of the application, correctly and automatically cloned from my old phone, I came across the standard *status* that WhatsApp places for you:

<br>
<br/>
<center>
<img src="/images/posts/whatsapp/whatsapp_postgresql_1.png" width="50%" />
</center>
<br/>
<br/>

The standard phrase is `Hey there! I'm using WhatsApp!`.
<br/>
I hate this automatically placed sentences, so I was trying to thin about something different, and then I decided that I did not want something different because, after all, I don't think many people spend their time reading your status.
<br/>
And then, I decided to let the world know I'm using PostgreSQL:

<br>
<br/>
<center>
<img src="/images/posts/whatsapp/whatsapp_postgresql_2.png" width="50%" />
</center>
<br/>
<br/>

It's not a very big contribution, but **it is a just a quick and easy way to let the world know about PostgreSQL**.

*If you like PostrgreSQL and the idea, please update your status too!*
