<div style="text-align: justify;">I <a href="https://github.com/fluca1978/JFK/commit/64d2369a24b40c7f819bda8a6c216b7935d528b8">imported</a> the good work of my friend Claudio into <a href="https://github.com/fluca1978/JFK">JFK</a>: such work allows experimentation of an idea about works that I slightly borrowed from Object Teams. There is still some clean up to be done, but a test case demonstrates the result.</div>
