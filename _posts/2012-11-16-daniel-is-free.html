<div style="text-align: justify;">According to the <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18626">last message sent from his wife</a>, Daniel is at home and fine:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq">&nbsp;Thank God he came home well, and is now recovering, we appreciate all the help and support of you! </blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I don't know if the battle is over, but at least Daniel's nightmare is!<br /><br /><i>Update</i>: as <a href="http://dantti.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/thank-you/">Daniel blogs</a>, he spent 6 days in jails and can now be again together with his family since he is free. The trial is not over though, but one piece is done! </div>
