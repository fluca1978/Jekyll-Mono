Again but no money, sorry pals, I tried.

# End result for me

I'm at the end of the third year in a row of [*No Shave November*](https://no-shave.org/), an interesting  initiative to grow cancer awareness.

<br/>
The end result is like the other past years: [I was unable to raise my fund bar](https://no-shave.org/member/fluca1978).
*But*, unlike the previous years, **I made much more more noise** this year about this initiative and its aim.
*This encourages me to try harder the next year!**


What about the *let them grow* part? Here it is the usual pictures:
