I remember I read something years ago, and since I'm starting over watching Big Bang Theory, I searched for the image.

# Konqueror on Big Bang Theory

Years ago I read something about one episode of *The Big Bang Thoery* showing a t-shirt related to [KDE](http://www.kde.org){:target="_blank"}, but I do not remember what, when and who.
<br/>
Since I'm now watching, in my spare time, the series again, I started searching that image, and I found:

it was a clear mention to **Konqueror**, the *catch-all* web browser of the time for the KDE desktop (if I remember right, at that time I was using *KDE 4*).
<br/>
Apparently, there is no other great major t-shirt appearing on the show (I searched for Emacs, Firefox, Eclipse, Linux, and so on).
