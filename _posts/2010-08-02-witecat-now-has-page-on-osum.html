<div style="text-align: justify;">I'm not sure it makes sense to have a page on <a href="http://osum.sun.com/">OSUM</a>, since the situation of <i>what was Sun's</i> is not clear to me, but I've created a page to make the WhiteCat project more visible. You can find the page <a href="http://osum.sun.com/group/whitecat">here</a>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, please take into account that the main information about the project will be available, of course, thru my blog.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I've used the same logo as it was adopted in the CTS 2010 poster.</div>
