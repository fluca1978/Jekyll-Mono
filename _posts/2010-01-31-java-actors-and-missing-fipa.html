Java <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actors</a> are becoming a well known way to build distributed, parallel, message-passing based applications. The theory behind actors is very similar to that behing agents, even if an agent more complex than an actor because have a smart part (sometimes called agenthood). However, since new Java actor frameworks are growing, I don't understand why <a href="http://www.fipa.org">FIPA</a> is not coming into the field defining some kind of standards for such paradigm. It could be the best of both world, but as far as I know there is <a href="http://www.pcs.usp.br/~coin-aamas06/10_commitment-43_16pages.pdf">only a paper</a> that tries to merge both.
