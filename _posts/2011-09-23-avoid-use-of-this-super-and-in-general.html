<div style="text-align: justify;">This can sound odd from me, that since my early days of OOP programming have always advocated the use of such qualifiers. The main reason I liked such qualifiers, and the main reason I presented to my students when teaching them OOP, was that the resulting code would be easier to read and, most notably, a lot of IDEs will bring up popups and code helpers to show you available completions. In other words, simply typing "this" will activate a popup that presents you with a list of choices between methods and fields to place in. <br />So what did change my mind? Why am I now advocating to avoid the use of qualifiers? Well, it is really simple: I switched back to some C code, and found myself comfortable while writing "unqualified" code. So I thought that in order to keep code clean and to get a more coherent syntax, avoiding qualifiers can help.<br />As an example consider the following piece of (imaginary) Java code:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; this.description = this.computeANewDescription();</span><br style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;" /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; this.setTimeAndDate( super.getTodayDate() );</span><br style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;" /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; this.setStatus( Status.STATUS_OK );</span></span><br /><br />Now the above code can be rewritten in the following way, assuming you also use static imports:<br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;" /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; description = computeANewDescription();</span><br style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;" /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; setTimeAndDate( getTodayDate() );</span><br style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;" /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; setStatus( STATUS_OK );</span></span><br /><br />Isn't it really much like a C code snippet? Apart keeping your fingers relaxed, due to not extra-typing keywords, the code is much more clean and can be read by any C developer.</div>
