The historical mailing list of the Italian `psql.it` group has been succesfully migrated!

# `psql.it` Mailing List is Back!

With the great work of people behind the *psql.it* Italian group the **first** (and for many years the only one) Italian language mailing list has been migrated to a new platform and is now online again!
<br/>
<br/>
On this mailing list you can find a few very talented people willing to help with your PostgreSQL-related problem or curiosity, to discuss the current status and the future of the development and anything else you would expect from a very technical mailing list. *Of course, the language is Italian!*.
<br/>
<br/>
The link to the new mailing list management panel is [https://www.freelists.org/list/postgresql-it](https://www.freelists.org/list/postgresql-it).
<br/>
Enjoy!
