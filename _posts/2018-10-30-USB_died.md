My main USB stick died, and while I had several backup copies, the damage was not zero!

# UBS Sticks...

I tend to keep all my personal data in a cyphered USB stick. Since a lot of time ago the stick died, I learnt to buy new sticks every so, make regular backup copies, and keep my data safer.

And I still do: for every data I keep incremental and full backups scattered across other devices.

But no matter, when a not-always online storage device (as an USB stick) dies, you loose data.

[Here it is a detailed description of what happened](https://superuser.com/questions/1369231/usb-device-detected-by-linux-system-but-unusable-with-no-medium-found-error) and what I tried to do to access my data on the USB stick.

In my case I lost around a month of data, that I was able to recreate almostly. Why such a big data loss? Because I do my backups monthly and I was just before a regular backup. *Damn!*

After this sad experience, I decided to increase the number of backup devices and the frequency of backups, at least to guarantee that I've always a weekly backup available.

Why not putting all the data into the cloud? After all it is encrypted.
True, but I don't like the idea of downloading and uploading the same piece of data over and over, and moreover I want to be able to evaluate my data offline.
