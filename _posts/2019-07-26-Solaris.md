A few days ago I had to log in a *foreign* Unix system, and I was astonished at the command prompt!

# The Most Ancient (running) System I Logged Into
For a moment I felt like *[Sam Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tron_characters#Sam_Flynn)* discovering [his father's ancient computer in the back of the gaming place](https://fluca1978.github.io/2017/11/21/TronLegacySunOS.html)! However, this was real, and a few days ago I had to log into a quite old Unix system:

I've removed the pieces of the text that can make this system recognizable, for obvious reasons.

<br/>
<br/>
So this is **SunOS 5.7** back from 1998. 
<br/>
If you take a deeper look at the screenshot, you will see the connection has been made via **telnet**, because that was the way *real sysadmins use to connect remotely* back in those days.
<br/>
It is not the first Solaris/SunOS machine I work with, but the most ancient one that I was using has been a *Solaris 8* (released in 2000) running on an *Ultra Sparc II* machine. I was using it at university, and it has been my very first approach to a real Unix.
<br/>
<br/>
Years later, 2004 if my brain serves me well, I used Solaris 9 on the same university laboratory, because I got the task of administering it and I had to reinstall everything.
<br/>
<br/>
After I left university and got a *real job*, I never had the chance to touch a Solaris system again until 2010, when I decided to give a try to OpenSolaris on 386 machines. It was a very short run, because many of the applications and packages I need in my day-to-day job were not present or did not compile seamless and, quite frankly, I had to do my job.
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years later, I got a task and met Solaris again: it was Solaris 9 running on some Ultra Sparc machines, but I don't remember which version.
<br/>
<br/>
And now, I had to work within the above system, that is **the most ancient SunOS I've ever logged into**, and please note that the above is [truly a Solaris (not a SunOS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)), despite the fact that the name `SunOS` kept being reported as the name of the kernel.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and by the way, such machine is also running **Oracle 8.1.6**, so it seems I will have fun with some stuff from the last century!
