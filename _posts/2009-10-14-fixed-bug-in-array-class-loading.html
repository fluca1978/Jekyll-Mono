Thanks to the effort of a friend of mine, Fernando, involved in the Aglets development, a bug about the class loading of an array of objects have been fixed. Today I commited the new code to the git repository.<br />The bug caused an agent, using an array of objects, to be not loaded well after a migration; the problem was that the Aglets class loader was unable to load the class of the array and instantiate, consequently, the array itself. This happened with a recent JVM (e.g., 1.6) and not with older ones, due to some minor changes in the new JVM array handling.
