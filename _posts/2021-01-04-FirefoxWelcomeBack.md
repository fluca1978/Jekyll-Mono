Today I turned on my Firefox web browser after 4 months...

Firefox knows I wasn't using it in a while
--

I've been away from my office keyword for around **4 months**, it is an huge period of time in a computer time.
I'm not going to describe here why, I could write someday a related post when I feel comfortable discussing my last eye-drama.
<br/>
Anyway, Firefox did noticed that I was not using it and today prompted me with a message at the bottom:


<br/>
<br/>
<center>
<img src="/images/posts/firefox/firefox_welcome_back.png" />
</center>
<br/>
<br/>

I don't define this as *spying* on my activity, even if I don't see the point in showing this message.
