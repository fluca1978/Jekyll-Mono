# Hacktoberfest 2017: got the shrew!

I've already [written about my second experience with Hacktoberfest 2017](/2017/10/31/Hacktoberfest.html), and just before Christmas I got my shrew!
The **t-shirt looks amazing**, and I was hoping for a couple more stickers to donate to my son and, yes, I really miss the octopus one to place on top of my laptop lid.
