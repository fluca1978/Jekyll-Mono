A very short introduction to this new site.

## Another site?
-----

I started blogging on the great [blogspot](http://blogspot.com) platform back in 2007, after the first [PGDay.IT](http://pgday.it).
While I find blogger a good platform, I decided to switch to a more comfortable one, in this case Jekyll and Github pages.

What does *comfortable* mean?

Well, it is no secret I've eyesight problems and my eyes are getting bad on a day-by-day basis. This means I tend to slow down my editing capabilities when not using well profiled tools, that in my case reduces to a dark theme Emacs with big fonts.

Yeah, I know, I can use *org-mode* to post to a blogger platform, and this is what I'm doing since more than an year, but why not try a new technology stack?

My old blog is available at [fluca1978.blogspot.com](http://fluca1978.blogspot.com), but I hope to integrate it back here for readers' comfort.
