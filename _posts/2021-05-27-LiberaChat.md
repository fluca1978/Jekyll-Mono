Is time to shut down `freenode`?

# Libera Chat

In the last week, there has been some momentum around `freenode.org`.
<br/>
<br/>
**In short, [PostgreSQL IRC channels moved from `irc.freenode.org` to `libera.chat`](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/162171589595.697.243052831879309654%40wrigleys.postgresql.org){:target="_blank"}.** 
<br/>
<br/>
This is not the only community that is migrating to the *new* Libera Chat IRC Service, and most notably (to me) **[Raku](https://www.raku.org/community/irc){:target="_blank"} and [FreeBSD](https://wiki.freebsd.org/IRC/Official-FreeBSD-IRC-channels-now-on-Libera-Chat){:target="_blank_"} decided to migrate**.
<br/>
<br/>
The main question about this service migration should be, obviously, *why*?
<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to find out a lot of articles and discussion on the web about, but in short the Freenode admins clashed with the owner of the network, and decided to quit and "fork" a new service.
<br/>
In particular, as you [can read here](https://gist.github.com/aaronmdjones/1a9a93ded5b7d162c3f58bdd66b8f491){:target="_blank"}:

<br/>
<br/>
```
The freenode user base should consider very strongly that a hostile entity
is now in operational control over the network, and is in posession of your
data.
```
<br/>
<br/>

I have not mangled all the information, and so my opinion is still blobby, but surely what you [can read here](https://freenode.net/news/freenode-is-foss){:target="_blank"} is not a good start to me: `[...]I've been the guardian and owner of freenode since 2017[...]`. This is the kind of approach that makes people irrational, since while it matters how much money you put into the project, this does not automagically provides you a role as *guardian*, or even gives you the ability to take decisions.
<br/>
This is open source, after all.
<br/>
<br/>
But there is [more to read](https://gist.github.com/realrasengan/88549ec34ee32d01629354e4075d2d48){:target="_blank"}, and to make your own opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
What is [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/){:target="_blank"}? It is an [organization](https://libera.chat/about){:target="_blank"} providing an hosting for IRC channels.
<br/>
I clearly suspect a lot of projects will progressively move to [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/){:target="_blank"}, and this will kill, I suspect, `freenode.org`.
<br/>
We'll see.
