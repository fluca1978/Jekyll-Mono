<div style="text-align: justify;">An <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/perl/perl.pdf">interesting approach</a> to teaching Perl in a way that reminds the Unix shell scripting. This does not seem to me something to suggest to who wants to become a Perl guru, but it will really help anybody who is moving towards Perl and has a good Unix/scripting knowledge.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">By the way, the best books on Perl I've ever read are those by Randal Schwartz.</div>
