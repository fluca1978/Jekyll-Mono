Last, I realized what is the best office I've ever worked into.

# The Best Office Ever

I have the luck to have an home office, something I did not had before because the house we were into was not large enough. I really enjoy spending time in my office, because it is of course the best office I've ever had. It is not that has been designed to be particularly functional, ergonomic, or whatever other fancy term you like, it is just **mine**.

<br/>
That made it as such customized as I can sit on my desk, having a look at the fireplace and my cats, in particular Sofia, purring alongside me.

And of course, my laptop always runs the *best editor ever*, or better, the *best ecosystem ever*, that reads as *Emacs*. Here you can see it in action while finishing my **[PostgreSQL 11 Server Side Programming Quick Start Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/postgresql-11-server-side-programming-quick-start-guide).
