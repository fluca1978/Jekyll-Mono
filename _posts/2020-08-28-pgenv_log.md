I've added a couple of very minimalistic features to `pgenv`.

# pgenv: get to know your logs

In these days a work of mine, related to PostgreSQL, is going to be tested. One quick way to get a fully functional PostgreSQL instance is to use [`pgenv`](https://github.com/theory/pgenv){:target="_blank"}.
<br/>
However, one user asked me how to find out quickly the problem why `pgenv` was unable to start his own cluster.
<br/>
<br/>
**Do your homework and read the logs!** is the correct answer to the problem.
<br/>
The  you realize that part of your aim is to help people embracing the technology, so why should not `pgenv` try to teach the user to do so?
<br/>
<br/>
And here are two very small and ridiculous features that could help some user to get used to learn the basis of every problem solving, especially with PostgreSQL.

## A quick look at the logs when things go wrong

The first problem is that when the cluster does not start, for any reason, `pgenv` correctly tells you to examine the logs.
<br/>
End of the story.
<br/>
That means that you have to mangle your logs thru your own favourite tool, even if you are an experienced database and system administrator. I'm lazy, so let's `pgenv` provide me a quick hint:

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
% pgenv start

PostgreSQL 12.1 NOT started, examine logs in /home/luca/git/misc/PostgreSQL/pgenv/pgsql/data/server.log

Following are the last 5 lines of the log, as a quick hint:
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] LOG:  could not bind IPv4 address "127.0.0.1": Address already in use
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] WARNING:  could not create listen socket for "localhost"
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] FATAL:  could not create any TCP/IP sockets
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] LOG:  database system is shut down

```

<br/>
<br/>
It is that simple: if something goes wrong, `pgenv` shows me the last bunch of lines of the logs. If I'm lucky, I will see the problem without having to manually type another command to dig into the logs (in the above, another cluster or process is holding the TCP/IP port 5432).
<br/>
There is no black magic here: `tail` is used to the rescue!


### Show me my logs

What if you don't remember where `pgenv` is storing your logs and want to see them to mail or ask for help?
<br/>
Here comes the new `log` command, that in turns invokes `tail` on the logs (assuming there is one log!). The beauty of using `tail` is that it becomes very simple to support every other flag `tail` does support, doing therefore "complex" log analysis.
<br/>
So, in the case you want your logs:

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
% pgenv log
Dumping the content of /home/luca/git/misc/PostgreSQL/pgenv/pgsql/data/server.log 

2020-08-28 03:29:19.903 CEST [11867] LOG:  aborting any active transactions

2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] WARNING:  could not create listen socket for "localhost"
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] FATAL:  could not create any TCP/IP sockets
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] LOG:  database system is shut down

```
<br/>
<br/>

and in the case you want something different:

<br/>
<br/>
```shell
% pgenv log -n 3 -f           
Dumping the content of /home/luca/git/misc/PostgreSQL/pgenv/pgsql/data/server.log 

2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] WARNING:  could not create listen socket for "localhost"
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] FATAL:  could not create any TCP/IP sockets
2020-08-28 03:29:39.343 CEST [13046] LOG:  database system is shut down
```
<br/>
<br/>

that prints the last three lines and waits for new logs to be displayed.


# Conclusions

The new `pgenv` functionalities are just toys, but I hope they can help people approaching this project that can really help, in turn, to get a cluster up and running.
