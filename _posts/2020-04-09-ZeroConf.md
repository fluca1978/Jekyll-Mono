I'm seeing that around all the world the conferences are being cancelled. This is also true for PostgreSQL related conferences.

# Are we at the ZeroConference point?

The situation around the planet is dramatic, to the point that our lifes have been deeply changed by the *COVID-19*.
One, small, consequence of all the measures to avoid the prolification of COVID-19, is that a lot of conferences have been cancelled.
<br/>
<br/>
PostgreSQL conferences are no exclusion, and a lot of events are going to be cancelled or pushed to the *video streaming* mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Among the others, **PGDay.IT has been cancelled**, and I think someone should advice also on the planet, not only the mailing list.
<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping for a streamed conference, but the web site clearly states the conference is postponed to the next year.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope PostgreSQL conferences, as all other technical conferences, can be soon
