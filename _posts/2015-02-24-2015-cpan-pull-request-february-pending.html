<h1>~</h1>


<div style="text-align: justify;">My February assignment was not a piece of cake: I got <i>MyCPAN::Indexer</i>, a module by the great <i>brain d foy</i>, yes the author of so many Perl Books, the launcher of the Perl Mongers, and...you know, pretty much a lot of the Perl world.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Ok, what chance could I have to comment and improve the code of brian?</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It does not matter, I did my homework at my very best.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The first step was to understand what the module was doing, and I have to say that the documentation did not helped me a lot. Then I had to try the module by myself in order to see when and how to make it working. And it took me a while to understand what should I do.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Please note that the module is by itself what brian calls a <i>modulino</i>, so a module that can be invoked also as a standalone application.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The code layout is...well, let me call <i>strange</i>. It is something I will not use, and something my Emacs refuses to use quite well, so this made changes a little more difficult. However, I limited myself to change the documentation and fix a few dependencies (optionals), as well as compressing a branch. Nothing really interesting, some monkey patching, but hey, it was a little too hard for me to do in a single month!</div><div style="text-align: justify;">But I'm really happy, even if at the time of writing my <a href="https://github.com/briandfoy/mycpan-indexer/pull/1">patch</a> has not yet been merged, and even if it will never be. It has been a great opportunity to be <i>forced</i> to learn from a real Perl guru!</div>
