A few days ago I got invited to join the [Perl 6 group on GitHub](https://github.com/perl6). Todays I placed my first trivial *autnomous* commit on the docs.

# That's scary!

After a few Pull Requests merged into the [Perl 6 documentation repository](https://github.com/perl6/doc), during the last couple of years, I got invited to join the group.

That's scary!

Having access to the full repos of Perl 6 simply means I can break anything, on one hand. On the other hand it means I can put back some of the effort Perl developers have given to me (and others) with such a beautiful language.

Nothing especial here, as long as the message that it's possible to join a Free Software group and contribute actively (and trivially) to it.

And just for the records, [here it is my one line commit](https://github.com/perl6/doc/commit/8ae8e7ef8a90b2b7e71cb776b957ff7c20b2ca30).
