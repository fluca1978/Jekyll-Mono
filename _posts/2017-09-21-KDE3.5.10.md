I took the time to upgrade my main desktop to KDE 5.10, and it is amazing. Allow me to explain why this
project is so great and why I like this powerful desktop.

## KDE 5.10 is amazing!
-----

A few days ago I spent some time upgrading my main desktop to a stable [Plasma Workspace](http://www.kde.org), or for short KDE 5.10.
It is well known KDE is my only and true desktop, and there as a time when my computer was always compiling and upgrading the desktop, but
in these days I tend to stay with a working instance the most and tend not to upgrade it quite often due to the fact that I need more
computer power and time to make things done than to upgrade my desktop.
This also means that what I find as *new* in this KDE version could be a well established feature in previous versions and I was not aware of them
or never tried directly.

Anyway, the update was a little problematic, but that was mainly due to the automatic upgrade of the Linux distribution I use, and that is another reason I tend to stay behind the bleeding edge version.

*Once finished I was astonished!*

First of all, *Breeze* is a really great theme, must better than the ugly (to me) *Air* and more consistent as it was the old *Oxygen*. The dark theme is very relaxing for who has eye problems like me.
Desktop effects work like a charm, and the application dashboard is something really cute, and much more useful than other desktop activities (yes [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org), I'm looking at you!), even if text search is a little slower (I believe that's due to the semantic desktop search).

I tried the *Global Menu* for applications, something like what OS 9 had several years ago (and yes, also KDE 1 did!), but I'm quite greedy on screen space, so I disabled it after a few hours. Instead, the choice of the menu within the application title bar is a lot more useful for me, especially if you think I tend to do a lot of things thru keyboard shortcuts (and therefore not needing the menu at all).

I showed my desktop to a few friends, and they pointed out that it was really similar to the OS X workspace.
It could be, I'm not sure since I'm not working with Apple systems by far, but I have to say that **KDE is deploying a rich and elegant workspace for free**, do other vendors do the same?
