I guess I have to get used to the new name.

# Raku

It is already an old news: **Perl 6 has definetely changed its name to *Raku* **.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't like it. Period.
<br/>
I don't like because I love the **Perl** name, and for me it is fine to express with a single word the fact that I can work with Perl 5 and Perl 6, or more in general, *with Perl*!
<br/>
<br/>
However, it seems that Perl as a single name was making too much confusion in the people minds, and since the compiler was already named *Rakudo*, I believe the language has been named *Raku**.
<br/>
Of course, the official website already reflect it in its description and also in the redirection of the name:

**Long life to `Raku`!**
