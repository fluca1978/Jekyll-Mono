<h1>~</h1>


<div style="text-align: justify;">Often, or better always, some of your friends, or colleagues, or co-workers in general will come up with a question about how to protect the code they write against people that want to steal it. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">"<i>I am so smart, I wrote this elegant, fast, reliable piece of code and I don't want anyone else to take it and embed it in their programs</i>" or something like that.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">When asked about how to hide your own source code I usually pick up a piece of the Perl FAQs that states:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>How can I hide the source for my Perl program?</i><br /><i>Delete it.[ ... ] Security through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs</i><br /><i>instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.</i></blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, in these days of the GitHub, BitBucket, Sourceforge and the others free repositories talking about code obfuscation is simply stupid: the whole world is sharing with you tons of source code and you, little tiny programmer, believe that your code is so great that you have to protect it running a "<i>macumba</i>" on anybody who just sees it?</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Well, I'm not so smart and my code is not so brilliant. And this is the reason why I strongly believe that my code should be public: on one hand I want to help people providing them ideas and programs, and on the other hand I'm thankful to anybody points me to errors or programming bad practices or whatever way I can improve my way of writing programs.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Of course there are techniques that are based on a crypto-loader that will decipher on the fly your (ciphered) code and run it, so that on the disk only a ciphered text will exist. But usually these techniques are not easy to use, and performance are not really good at all.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But sometimes you are forced to keep your code hidden due to some contract terms or policies. Well, in such case the only solution I see is to not give away any source code at all.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">But be aware pal, reverse engineering is something hard but not impossible. After all <a href="http://samba.org/">Samba</a> was a reverse engineering effort, and did you know that <a href="http://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> runs on Sun Ultrasparc III machine due to reverse engineering? </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I guess the only true way to keep your code only for you is to <i>edit-save-compile-run</i> only into your brain. Oh, and not dream about it because some scientist with some <i>dream-machine-from-the-future</i> could get it out of your brain too!</div>
