<div style="text-align: justify;">I promised <a href="http://fluca1978.blogspot.com/2010/08/jfk-java-methods-on-steroids.html">JFK</a> would have been available publicly, but then I was too much busy to publish it. I did it today, so you can access <a href="https://github.com/fluca1978/JFK">JFK source tree via GitHub</a>. Enjoy it!</div>
