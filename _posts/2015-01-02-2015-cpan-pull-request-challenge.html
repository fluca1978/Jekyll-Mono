<div style="text-align: justify;">I'm going to participate to the 2015 CPAN Pull Request Challenge, an effort to make developers join the Perl community and contribute back some code.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The idea is simple and beautiful: each month you are assigned a random CPAN dist and have to inspect, study, read it and propose something (a pull request) to improve it. It could be a bug fixing, ticket issue, code optimization, documentation, and so on. Everything that can be accepted back from the original author.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I'm a little nervous: it has been a lot since I do not program day by day using Perl, but I'm quite happy to have the opportunity to learn something from the masters and, most notably, to contribute stuff back to this great community.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Let's see wat will happen!</div>
