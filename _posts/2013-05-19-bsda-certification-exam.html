<h1>~</h1>


<div style="text-align: justify;">One of the reasons that forced me to go to the Central Europe BSD Day 2013 was to take part in the BSDA Certification Exam. <b>And I'm proud to say that now I'm BSDA certified!</b> I've passed the exam with a quite high score, near the maximum, but I have to admit that I misread a few questions...I guess it is normal considering the stress of the exam itself.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EPTWMcCjtt4/UZjEoElckkI/AAAAAAAABKY/Ys_uvwv8GPY/s1600/bsda_exam.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EPTWMcCjtt4/UZjEoElckkI/AAAAAAAABKY/Ys_uvwv8GPY/s400/bsda_exam.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I'm not supposed to talk about the exam contents, since one thing that any candidate has to sign and agree on is a non-disclosure agreement. However, I can say that the exam is very good in quality: questions are well written and, in my opinion, quite focused on the subject. Moreover, the correction of the question was in time, and therefore I received the results before the deadline for the correction has passed.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">How did I prepared to the exam? Well, I fired up four virtual machines, each one with one of the four mainstreams BSD releases (actually I was firing up five machines, but I used FreeBSD instead of PCBSD because I did not need a graphical environment to test my capabilities). On each machine I exercised all the confgurations and commands the BSDCG Study Guide recommends, and I noticed the differences among any command and stack. Being mainly a FreeBSD user, I found myself at home on FreeBSD systems, but recognized the need for more practice on different BSDs, and having virtual machine was a good way of comparing all the four main systems.</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
