<div style="text-align: justify;">I was reading the Planet KDE when some <i>strange </i>posts got my attention: someone was seeking for help for Daniel Nicoletti. Daniel is a KDE contributor, his last activities were on printing management and the Apper package kit. While moving to a KDE summit, he was arrested and is currently in jail.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">To understand why it is required to give&nbsp; a short story.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">More than <a href="http://dantti.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/there-is-still-hope/">one year ago</a>, his one year and half old daughter died in a car accident while the Nicoletti family was travelling in Argentina.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">A few days ago, on November the 8th, while travelling to <i>hackfest.cm</i>, he was arrested by the Germany police and went to jail. In short, he has been sought by international police for the murder of his daughter.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I don't know the facts, but I suspect it is not Daniel's fault. I never met Daniel, even if he helped me on the KDE developers mailing list a few times.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This incident reports to my mind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_reiser#Nina_Reiser.27s_disappearance">Hans Reiser's one</a>, just because two great developers have been marked as guilty.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>As a father, I cannot image a nightmare worst than loosing your child and being convicted about that.</i><br /><br />That is why I made my little donation hoping it can help finding the right resources to clarify the incident. Please consider doing the same.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/18626"><img alt="Click here to lend your support to:  URGENT flights to go to the Brazilian Consulate in Munich and make a donation at www.pledgie.com !" border="0" height="79" src="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/18626.png?skin_name=chrome" width="320" /></a></div>
