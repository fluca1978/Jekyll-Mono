How hard can it be to grab a copy of PostgreSQL 12 (still in beta) and install on your computer for testing, without having to deal with your existing database?

# PostgreSQL 12 beta 4 up and running in less than six minutes

I have realized a very short, and to some extent, boring video to demonstrate how [`pgenv`](https://github.com/theory/pgenv/) can simplify the installation of **PostgreSQL 12 beta 4** (as well as other versions of course).
<br/>
<br/>
The video shows how automated it could be to install the beta version on a FreeBSD machine.
For the very impatients, the commands are essentially:
```
% pgenv build 12beta4
% pgenv use 12beta4
% psql -h localhost -U postgres template1
```

but the last command is, of course, the proof that all is up and running.
<br/>
<br/>
As you will see, the most of the time is spent in doing the actual compilation of the software. The value added by `pgenv` is that you don't have to deal with download links and commands to initialize your database. And once you are done, you can simply nuke the `pgsql-12beta4` directory that will remove binaries and data.

Of course, [`pgenv`](https://github.com/theory/pgenv/) can do a lot more than just downloading and compiling PostgreSQL, but the above demonstrate how it simplifies even the *boring* setup tasks.
