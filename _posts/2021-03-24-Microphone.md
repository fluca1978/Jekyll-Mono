I needed to improve the audio quality of my battle station!

# A new Mic!

One thing I had to do was to improve the audio quality of my battle station, so I decided to switch from headphones to a setup with external audio. That made me buy a new microphone, and I decided to invest some money on a good quality microphone, so I got a *Trust Mantis* USB microphone.

It is a little too much space-consuming than what I would like, but quite frankly the overall quality is awesome and I can now record audio without any environmental noise!
