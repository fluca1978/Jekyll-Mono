I've already written about the importance of having a public recognition about everyone's effort.


# When your effort is publicly recognized (2)

It could sound shy, but I feel very happy whjen someone else expresses his public positive opinion about me and my work. Today a [very positive comment](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/1939#issuecomment-385980656) hit me with regarding to my last activity in improving the Perl 6 documentation:

>> [...] you consistently do excellent work [...]

That's a simple way to make you feel useful.
To make you feel at home.
To make you wish to donate another piece of your time to the community.
