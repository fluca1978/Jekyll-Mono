A simple snippet about some idiom I carry on from my Perl 5 day-to-day work

## Perl5 -> Perl6: hash, keys and grep
-----

Imagine you have an hash (may be a *constant*) that contains a set of available running mode, something defined as follows:

``` perl
my %available_modes =  csv => 'Comma Separated Values',
                       org => 'Emacs-org mode compatible',
                       sql => 'SQL commands',
                      ;

```

Imagine your application handle a ```$mode``` variable that identifies the operating mode among those available as the hash keys.
Now you want to run *all available* modes if no specific mode has been set or if an *alien* mode has been passed.

Here's how I would do it in Perl 5:

``` perl
@modes_to_process = sort keys %available_modes if ( ! $mode
                                                   || ! grep( $mode, keys %available_modes ) );
```

The idea is quite simple: the postfix ```if``` checks if ```$mode``` has been defined or if it does not appear in the list of keys, and I use
the ```grep``` operator to achieve that. If none condition is verified, all the sorted keys are used in ```@modes_to_process```.

In Perl 6 I've achieved the following so far:

``` perl
    @modes_to_process = %available_modes{}:k.sort if ( %available_modes{}:k.grep( /$mode/ ).elems <= 0 );
```

Here the idea is somehow simpler, even if the code is a little less readable at glance. The postfix ```if```    extracts the keys (thru the ```k``` adverb), the list is then *grepped* with a regular expression consisting only of the ```$mode``` variable. The result should produce another list, and if the count of elements is zero than the list is empty (so the grep failed).

The adoption of a regular expression based grep has a huge advantage: it does work either when ```$mode``` is defined or when it is not.

Another, shorter, way is to check if the ```$mode``` has been defined and is contained into the hash keys as follows:

``` perl
my @modes_to_process = %available_modes{}:k.sort if ( ! $mode.defined || ( %available_modes{ $mode }:!exists ) );
```

the idea here is to use the adverb ```:!exists``` (negation of *exists*) on the hash indexed by ```$mode```.
**Please note that the adverb has to be parhentesized or it will try to be evaluated as infix instead of circumfix** (thanks to [Brandon](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2017/09/msg4316.html)).
