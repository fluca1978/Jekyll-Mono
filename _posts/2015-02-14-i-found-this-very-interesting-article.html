<div style="text-align: justify;">I found this <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/camspi/2015/02/hire-good-developers.html">very interesting article</a> on how to perform a good job interview in the case you don't want to hire a good developer. In other words, do we still need to focus on the <i>merge-sort</i> or alike to know that we are facing a skilled developer?</div>
