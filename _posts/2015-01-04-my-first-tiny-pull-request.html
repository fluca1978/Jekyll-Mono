<div style="text-align: justify;">So I spent a few hours studying my first module, the <a href="https://github.com/theory/test-pod"><i>Test::Pod</i></a>, and produce a few commits to make some small changes to the existing code in order to improve it (or at least, I hope so). The pull request can be found <a href="https://github.com/theory/test-pod/pull/7">here</a>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Despite these small changes, I'm detailing here the approach I will try to use as a checklist during the challenge, in order to make it a path for learning and for not-breaking things:</div><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>run all the tests in the distribution, in order to see if there is any failure (it should not be), and if so, start from such tests;</li><li>search for open issues/tickets, and see if any of them is good for work on;</li><li>read the dist documentation, see if it contains typos and/or errors and/or missing parts;</li><li>read the code and see if there is something obvious that can be improved (e.g., <i>use strict</i>);</li><li>inspect the code and see if it does what the documentation says. </li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">Of course, it is required to iterate on each step and, of course, to test every single change against the test suite (and maybe provide a new test for that).&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is important to not produce <i>work for the original author</i>, and therefere:</div><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>do not change code only because I would have written it with a different name, logic, conditional or alike. Try instead to make code more concise keeping readibility;</li><li>do not provide code that breaks and test every single change at least for what it is possible and for what is the understanding of the problem and of the language;</li><li>commits must have a good description of every single change, so that the original author can understand what was the intention of every change;</li><li>keep commits as small as possible.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">I'll refine the above checklist as I go on the challenge.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, a few utilities can help in the work, most notably <i>perlcritic</i>, <i>perltidy</i> and <i>Devel::Cover</i> and <i>Devel::NTYProf</i> or similar. </div>
