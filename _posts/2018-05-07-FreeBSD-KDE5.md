Seems to me a new port has landed on FreeBSD!


# KDE 5 on FreeBSD

An article on [Planet KDE](http://planet.kde.org) got my attention: as described in [this short article](https://euroquis.nl/bobulate/?p=1851) KDE 5 (meaning Plasma and other stuff) landed in FreeBSD ports.

A quick update on my machine revealed it:

```sh
% ls -l /usr/ports/x11/kde5  
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  1645 May  3 14:32 Makefile
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   469 May  4 15:16 pkg-descr
```

I've not tried it yet, but I'm quite excited there's a chance to get Plasma 5 running at an up-to-date version on FreeBSD!

Thank you developers!
