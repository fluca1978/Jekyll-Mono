<div style="text-align: justify;">I believe there is a strong understimation of Open Source work today: people complains more and more everyday without taking into account that who does Open Source is donating her time and efforts to the whole community.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having stated that, it is really simple, in my very own opinion, that developers have the rights to work on what make them happy, not on what will make the users' happy.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time, the two side of happiness coincide.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In this scenario, before expressing rage against a group of developers without providing help, it is better to remember that you, the final user, did not hire the developers themselves, and therefore they are free to ignore you.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">For a pratical example, see <a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=142571609625736&amp;w=3">here</a>&nbsp; and if you have a little respect for yourself, never reply like <a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=142575904902324&amp;w=3">this!</a></div>
