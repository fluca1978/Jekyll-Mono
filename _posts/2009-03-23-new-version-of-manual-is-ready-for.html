After four years a new version of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7905">Aglets User Manual is available for downloading</a> at SourceForge.net.<br />Please note that we have always worked to the manual, improving and fixing the first version I wrote once I was in charge of the project itself, but before now no downloadable versions were officially available (even if the CVS repository allows public checkout).<br />Now, thanks to the efforts of some developers, the manual has been improved and is now available for users. Please refer to this last version of the manual.<br /><br />Work on the manual has not yet finished, and we are continuously improving it.
