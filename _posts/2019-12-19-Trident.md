Somehow, this is bad stroke to FreeBSD in my personal opinion.

# Project Trident is not anymore running FreeBSD

It is not a fresh news, but [according to the official announcement reported here](https://project-trident.org/post/os_migration/){:target=_blank} **Project Trident (was PC-BSD) is going to switch from FreeBSD to Void Linux**.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally learnt about that while I was searching for a new `ISO` to download and test on my pc during the holidays, and I was suspecting something from [Void Linux Alpha Release](https://project-trident.org/download/){:target=_blank** reported in the download page.
<br/>
<br/>
The following is, as usual, my own opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
**This is really bad to FreeBSD!**
<br/>
I was a PCBSD user, I also sponsored the project with some tiny donation, and I'm been a fan of FreeBSD since ten or more years now. Now, one thing FreeBSD is lacking, at least from the desktop perspective, is a pure desktop based installation system. PCBSD, then TrueOS, then Project Trident was aimed to provide a rich workstation based on FreeBSD and the rolling release used by the latter was really awesome.
<br/>
The reason the project switched to Linux, or better *is switching*, are pretty much that Linux offers more hardware support for laptop and home device hardware, like graphic cards. I don't know [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/){:target=_blank} so I cannot judge this choice, but it looks like a fresh-air in the Linux panorama since it is based on [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/){:target=_blank} as opposed to widely adopted `systemd` and [xbps](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps){:target=_blank} package manager.
<br/>
In any case, leaving the FreeBSD road will impact very much the adoption of this wonderful operating system on the desktop and quite frankly I cannot consider this a really nice choice.
<br/>
<br/>
And what about TrueOS? Well, the [download page](https://pkg.trueos.org/iso/unstable/){:target=_blank} does not show anything fresh since august 2019, so I guess the latter is going to be left alone too.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not good for FreeBSD.
At least, in my opinion.
