<div style="text-align: justify;">I'm proud to announce that the Editor in Chief has officially asked me to become a member of the Editorial Review Board of the <a href="http://www.igi-global.com/ijats">International Journal of Agent Technologies and Systems</a>. And I'm happy to say I accepted this opportunity, so now I'm officially on the Editorial Review Board of IJAS. <br />This means that I will be selected to do paper reviews and to evaluated scientific works submitted to this journal. I see this as an opportunity to improve my scientific skills and I'll do my best to peer review every work I will be ask to review.</div>
