In the last training of the 2008 I weared my new quiver, an Angel quiver that my parents gave me as Christmas gift. The following are some pictures of my new quiver, that is a black main body with blue lace and white stripes. I put my surname (<span style="font-style: italic;">fluca</span>) on the quiver body with orange letters, but I did not put it on the belt since I don't want my quiver to be too much showy. The belt is, of course, black, with white stripes that recall the stripes on the quiver body.<br />The quiver has a very comfortable shape, and its material is really solid and light.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yhEX77VFKnM/SV9gbHLVFwI/AAAAAAAAARs/ySxJQxFi1rA/s1600-h/dsc03866.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yhEX77VFKnM/SV9gbHLVFwI/AAAAAAAAARs/ySxJQxFi1rA/s400/dsc03866.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287050506455553794" border="0" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yhEX77VFKnM/SV9g3NMZEcI/AAAAAAAAAR8/g4fOyOxEkTI/s1600-h/dsc03871.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yhEX77VFKnM/SV9g3NMZEcI/AAAAAAAAAR8/g4fOyOxEkTI/s400/dsc03871.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287050989106958786" border="0" /></a><br />I'm very happy about this gift, and it is very important for me since it came from my parents, that have spent a lot of time and efforts in my young archery education. It is also for this reason that I placed the word <span style="font-style: italic;">fluca</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">luca </span>on the quiver, and my parents know what it means to us.<br />Since I ordered the quiver directly from Japan, I decided to make it even more custom applying a golden dragoon on the pochette.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yhEX77VFKnM/SV9goH29B7I/AAAAAAAAAR0/xKe-TUIdcZQ/s1600-h/dsc03869.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yhEX77VFKnM/SV9goH29B7I/AAAAAAAAAR0/xKe-TUIdcZQ/s400/dsc03869.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287050729976825778" border="0" /></a><br />I ordered the quiver at <a href="http://web.mac.com/akinorihirama/ANGEL_DIRECT_english/Welcome_2.html">Angel Direct</a>, that is the <a href="http://www.angel-japan.net/engindex.htm">Angel </a>front-end for international orders, and I must admit that people at Angel Direct has been very  kind and available. In particular <span class="nfakPe">Akinori</span> Hirama, that provided me unvaluable support in deciding the colors and the finishes of the whole quiver.<br /><br />I've always dreamed about an Angel quiver, but I was also scared of wearing it, since it is the champions' quiver, and I'm no more, not now, a champion. On the other hand, having this gift from my parents stresses how archery has been important in my youth and my family.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: right;">I'm very proud of this quiver and of the gift my parents did to me.<br /></div>
