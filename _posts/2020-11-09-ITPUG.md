Something is changing in ITPUG?

# ITPUG has a new board of directors
---

I've recently have been contacted by a friend of mine claiming that the ITPUG (*Italian PostgreSQL Users' Group*) board of directors has changed, and that's true as you can see from the [association page](https://www.itpug.org/about/){:target="_blank"}.
<br/>
Having been a member of ITPUG form its very conception to the end of 2016, I know pretty much every member of the actual *fresh* board of directors, and I hope to see a jump forward in the manaement of the association.
<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK, there are members that want to make ITPUG much more user-friendly.
<br/>
And there are members who deserve it!

<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!
