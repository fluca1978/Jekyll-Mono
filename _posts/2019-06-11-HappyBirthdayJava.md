Java has just turned 24 years old. Happy Birthday Java!

# Happy Birthday Java!
On May 23rd 2019 Java turned 24 years old, and you can find a lot of blog posts around the world greetings about how much long Java has been a succesful programming language.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to join the world saying **Happy Birthday Java!**
<br/>
<br/>
I have to thank you, because knowing you made me able to run me my University first lecturer class ever. And a lot of other lectures in the following years.
<br/>
Thank you Java, because I was able to do such a lot of research stuff based on your missing dynamism (ops!).
<br/>
I have to thank you for my day-by-day job, and therefore for being able to pay the rent!
<br/>
I must thank you for forcing me to learn other languages, like Perl. After all, and I'm not going to start a flame here, a `map` like approach came only in [version 1.8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html#forEach-java.util.function.Consumer-)!
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, I'm not a big fan of Java anymore, but I do like the language and the tooling as it is evolving. Unluckily, I strongly believe there is too much pressure from the vendors on which features are going to be included in which version of the language. Believe it or not, other *truly* open language did have *latest-collest** Java features ages ago.
<br/>
It sounds to me Java is not focused anymore on letting you do the job, rather on making you stack pile of software to get to do the job.
<br/>
But hey, 24 years old is a great accomplishment!
<br/>
<br/>
**Happy Birthday Java!**
