<div style="text-align: justify;">It did not suprise me to find an article about <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-strange-birth-and-long-life-of-unix/0"><i>Unix</i></a> on the 2011 last issue of the IEEE Spectrum magazine. While start reading the article, that I found quite accurate and precise, I was thinking it was&nbsp; a tribute to the great Dennis Ritchie (<i>dmr</i>), one of the Unix inventors. Surprisingly, it was not!&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The article tells about the Unix history, but did not report at all any tribute to <i>dmr</i>, except for this three lines statement:</div><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Many other, often very personal, tributes to Ritchie and his enormous  influence on computing were widely shared after his death this past  October.</blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The article also did not include a personal photo of Mr. Ritchie, or better, it does include the classical and well known picture of him with his friend and colleague Mr. Thompson, but it also includes a personal photo of the latter and none of Mr. Ritchie. I'm not going to accuse IEEE Spectrum, and IEEE in general, since it did a <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/software/dennis-ritchie-1941-2011">blog post about the death of Mr. Ritchie</a>. Nevertheless I find this article is missing a great tribute to one of the men that changed the world at all. Without Mr. Ritchie (and the others) we would not have any sort of *nix, including the one that runs on smartphones, tablet, and so on. While blog posts are going to survive much longer than printed paper, I think that not doing a tribute to Mr. Ritchie in one of the mainstream magazines of IEEE has been a lack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Similar considerations can be done for the missing of Mr. Jobs. While I'm not a fan of the latter, I think that a "computing" magazine should not have missed such kind of tributes.</div>
