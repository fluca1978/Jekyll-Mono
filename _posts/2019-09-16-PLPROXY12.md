There is a new release of PL/Proxy out there!

# New Release of PL/Proxy

There is a new exciting release of PL/Proxy: **[version 2.9 has been released a few hours ago](https://plproxy.github.io/downloads/files/2.9/plproxy-2.9.tar.gz)**!
<br/> <br/>
This is an important release because [it adds support for upcoming PostgreSQL 12](https://github.com/plproxy/plproxy/commit/d0a83211e1f71dac0bfd620741fee04eeded3173). The main problem with PostgreSQL 12 has been that `Oid`` is now a regular column, meaning that `HeapTupleGetOid`` is no longer a valid macro. I first proposed a [patch](https://github.com/plproxy/plproxy/pull/38/commits/4de2dec2a91a44dae6a89d88f5bb0eb12eaaeabc) that was based on the C preprocessor to get rid of older PostgreSQL version.
<br/><br/> <br/>
The solution implemented by Marko Kreen [is of course much more elegant](https://github.com/plproxy/plproxy/commit/d0a83211e1f71dac0bfd620741fee04eeded3173) and is based on defining *helper* functions that are pre-processed depending on the PostgreSQL version.
<br/> <br/>
Enjoy *proxying*!
