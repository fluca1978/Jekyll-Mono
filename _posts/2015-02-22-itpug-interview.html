<h1>~</h1>


<div style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to the effort of some of our associates, we were able to perform a short interview to our associates themselves in order to see how ITPUG is working and how they feel within the association.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The results, in italian, are available <a href="http://fluca1978.blogspot.it/2015/02/sondaggio-itpug_23.html">here</a> for a first brief description.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a general trend, ITPUG is going fine, or even better of how it was going a few years before. However there is still a lot of work to do in order to spread the PostgreSQL word and to make our associates a little more involved in the community itself.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a last word, I believe this kind of interviews should be performed on a regular basis in order to keep under control the work of the association and of its members.<br /><br /><b>Update: Feb 23</b><br />It seems that this kind of interview, and consequently the result inspection/analysys, generated a good discussion among the ITPUG members, that is I'm proud of thia other interesting result in the general management of the association.<b>&nbsp;</b> </div>
