On Christmas Eve I got my 2019 shrew!

# Hacktoberfest 2019: Shrew Arrived!

This is the fourth experience in the [Hacktoberfest contest](/2019/10/31/Hacktoberfest.html){:target=_blank}, and this year I was much more busy to provide *quantity*, and moreover I tried to improve the *quality* of my Pull Requests.

On Christmas Eve I got the shrew: again, **an amazing t-shirt** and a bunch of stickers that my son immediatly stolen!
