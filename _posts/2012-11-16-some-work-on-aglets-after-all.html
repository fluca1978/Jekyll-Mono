<div style="text-align: justify;">I don't remember the last time I did some work on the Aglets platform, but in the last days something have moved. Thanks to the great work by Thomas, the platform is moving to a much more easy deployment. I took the chance to do a code clean up and to fix some annoying problems with the terrible <i>AGLETS_HOME</i> variable and file paths that were referring to it.</div>
