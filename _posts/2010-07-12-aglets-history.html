<div style="text-align: justify;">Today I made a really mess with the Aglets Git repository! It happened that I pushed a not yet merged branch, because I was in a rush and my brain was outside somewhere walking...</div><div style="text-align: justify;">What I was doing was converting the whole Aglets history from the old CVS repository to the Git one I created one year ago.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Now the repository is fine again, and I've also done a few changes in some examples and classes that did not compile before.</div>
