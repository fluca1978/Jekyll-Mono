My latest book talking about PostgreSQL

# Learn PostgreSQL - a new book
---


I'm really excited to introduce you to a new *PostgreSQL book* entitled **Learn PostgreSQL**, written by myself and my good friend *Enrico*.


Yesterday my first commercial book in the PostgreSQL landscape was officially published: **[PostgreSQL 11 Server Side Programming Quick Start Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/postgresql-11-server-side-programming-quick-start-guide)!**

The book covers PostgreSQL 12 and 13 and contains 20 chapters explaining how to install a cluster, how to set up for first connections, basic usage of SQL and data types, the administration of a cluster including role management, statistics and performances, log analysis and tuning, with a eye on backups. The last section of the book is dedicated to replication, both physical and logical.

<br/>
<br/>
It has been an hard word to complete the book, and I would like to thank Enrico for having written this with me.
We are really proud and believe it delivers a good content and a complete presentation of our beloved database.



<br/>
<br/>
A quick book outline is the following one:
<br/>

### Part 1

There is of course much more to describe about the book, but so far I'm still recovering from an eye surgery so I will come back in the following weeks to discuss the book.

In the meantime you can have a look at the [official repository hosting the code examples](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-PostgreSQL){:target="_blank"}.
