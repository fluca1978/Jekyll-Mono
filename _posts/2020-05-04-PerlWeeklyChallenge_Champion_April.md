I am really proud to have made it to the top on April!

# Perl Weekly Challenge: April Champion

Today I opened the [Perl Weekly Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/){:target="_blank"} in order to read the tasks to perform, and *with my pleasure*, **I discovered that I am been selected as the champion for April 2020**:

<br/>
It is an honor and a pleasure, and I have to really thanks Mohammad for creating this interesting challenge because, apart from let me learning more about Raku, this helped me in *making the COVID-19 period less strange** than what it really is around the planet.
<br/>
I strongly encourage everyone that wants to puzzle at Perl and Raku problems to have a look at the challenge and try to do it.
<br/>
**The only thing you can obtain from participating, is to improve your Perl skills!**


## Update

When I was selected as April Champion, I noticed that a few blog entries were missing from my ranking poition. I sent an email to Mohammad that promptly fixed the problem, so that I'm, at the time of writing, **ranked 24** in the *Centurion Club*.
