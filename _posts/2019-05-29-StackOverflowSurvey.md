Stack Overflow 2019 Suvery results are available, and PostgreSQL is almost leading in the database field.

# PostgreSQL is almost the best (according to Stack Overflow Survery)

According to the 2019 suvery made by Stack Overflow and [available here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology), **PostgreSQL is the second top database**, slightly ahead of Microsoft SQL Server and cleary ahead of Oracle. And this is true both for *community* and *professional* users that take the survey.

PostgreSQL is keeping its high position year after year and this means that the database is growing as a professional choice. In particular, in the *professional* users' opinion PostgreSQL is more used and MySQL and MS SQL loose some points.
