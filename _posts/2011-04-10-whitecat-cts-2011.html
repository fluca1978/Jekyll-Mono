<h1>~</h1>


<div style="text-align: justify;">I'm proud to announce that WhiteCat has been accepted as regular paper work at <a href="http://cts2011.cisedu.info/">CTS 2011</a>. The paper that will be presented at the conference shows improvements since the past versions of the framework. Moreover the paper presents a bird's eye view of the framework itself demonstrating its integrability with other role and agent systems.</div>
